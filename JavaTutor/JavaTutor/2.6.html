<a name="basics.3.1">2.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Built-in Subroutines and Functions</a>
</h3>


<p>Recall that a subroutine is a set of program instructions that have been
chunked together and given a name.  A subroutine is designed to perform some
task.  To get that task performed in a program, you can "call" the subroutine
using a subroutine call statement.  In <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c4/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>,
you'll learn how to write your own subroutines, but you can get a lot done in a
program just by calling subroutines that have already been written for you. In
Java, every subroutine is contained either in a class or in an object. Some classes
that are standard parts of the Java language contain predefined subroutines
that you can use. A value of type <span class="classname">String</span>, which is an object, contains
subroutines that can be used to manipulate that string.  These subroutines are
"built into" the Java language.  You can call all these
subroutines without understanding how they were written or how they work.
Indeed, that's the whole point of subroutines: A subroutine is a "black box"
which can be used without knowing what goes on inside.</p>


<p>Let's first consider subroutines that are part of a class.  One of the 
purposes of a class is to group together some variables and subroutines,
which are contained in that class.
These variables and subroutines are called <span class="newword">static members</span> 
of the class. You've seen one example: In a class that defines a
program, the <span class="code">main()</span> routine is a static member of the class. The parts
of a class definition that define static members are marked with the reserved
word "<span class="code">static</span>", such as the word "static" in <span class="code">public static void main...</span>

</p>


<p>When a class contains a static variable or subroutine, the name of the class is part
of the full name of the variable or subroutine.  For example,
the standard class named <span class="classname">System</span> contains a subroutine named
<span class="code">exit</span>.  To use that subroutine in your program, you must refer to it as
<span class="code">System.exit</span>.  This full name consists of the name of the class that contains
the subroutine, followed by a period, followed by the name of the subroutine.
This subroutine requires an integer as its parameter, so you would actually use it with
a subroutine call statement such as</p>


<pre>System.exit(0);</pre>


<p>Calling <span class="code">System.exit</span> will terminate the program and shut down the
Java Virtual Machine. You
could use it if you had some reason to terminate the program before the end of
the <span class="code">main</span> routine. (The parameter 
tells the computer why the program was terminated.  A parameter value of 0
indicates that the program ended normally. Any other value indicates that
the program was terminated because an error was detected, so you could
call <span class="code">System.exit(1)</span> to indicate that the program is ending because of
an error.  The parameter is sent back to the operating system; in practice,
the value is usually ignored by the operating system.)</p>


<p>
<span class="classname">System</span> is just one of many standard classes that come
with Java.  Another useful class is called <span class="classname">Math</span>.
This class gives us an example of a class that contains
static variables: It includes the variables <span class="code">Math.PI</span> and <span class="code">Math.E</span>
whose values are the mathematical constants π and&nbsp;e.
<span class="classname">Math</span> also contains a large number of mathematical "functions."
Every subroutine performs some specific task. For some subroutines, that
task is to compute or retrieve some data value. Subroutines of this type are
called <span class="newword">functions</span>. We say that a function
<span class="newword">returns</span> a value. Generally, the returned value is meant to be
used somehow in the program that calls the function.
</p>


<p>You are familiar with the mathematical function that computes the square
root of a number. The corresponding function in Java is called <span class="code">Math.sqrt</span>.
This function is a static member subroutine of the class named <span class="classname">Math</span>.
If <span class="code">x</span> is any numerical value, then <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span> computes and
returns the square root of that value. Since <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span> represents a
value, it doesn't make sense to put it on a line by itself in a subroutine call
statement such as</p>


<pre>Math.sqrt(x);   // <b>This doesn't make sense!</b>
</pre>


<p>What, after all, would the computer do with the value computed by the
function in this case? You have to tell the computer to do something with the
value. You might tell the computer to display it:</p>


<pre>System.out.print( Math.sqrt(x) );  // Display the square root of x.</pre>


<p>or you might use an assignment statement to tell the computer to store that
value in a variable:</p>


<pre>lengthOfSide = Math.sqrt(x);</pre>


<p>The function call <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span> represents a value of type
<span class="ptype">double</span>, and it can be used anyplace where a numeric literal of type
double could be used.  The <span class="code">x</span> in this formula represents the
parameter to the subroutine; it could be a variable
named "x", or it could be replaced by any expression that represents a numerical
value.  For example, <span class="code">Math.sqrt(2)</span> computes the square root of 2,
and <span class="code">Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b)</span> would be legal as long as <span class="code">a</span>
and <span class="code">b</span> are numeric variables.</p>


<p>The <span class="classname">Math</span> class contains many static member functions. Here is a
list of some of the more important of them:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="code">Math.abs(x)</span>, which computes the absolute value of <span class="code">x</span>.</li>


<li>The usual trigonometric functions, <span class="code">Math.sin(x)</span>,
<span class="code">Math.cos(x)</span>, and <span class="code">Math.tan(x)</span>. (For all the trigonometric
functions, angles are measured in radians, not degrees.)</li>


<li>The inverse trigonometric functions arcsin, arccos, and arctan, which are
written as: <span class="code">Math.asin(x)</span>, <span class="code">Math.acos(x)</span>, and
<span class="code">Math.atan(x)</span>.  The return value is expressed in radians, not degrees.</li>


<li>The exponential function <span class="code">Math.exp(x)</span> for computing the number e
raised to the power <span class="code">x</span>, and the natural logarithm function
<span class="code">Math.log(x)</span> for computing the logarithm of <span class="code">x</span> in the base
e.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">Math.pow(x,y)</span> for computing <span class="code">x</span> raised to the power
<span class="code">y</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">Math.floor(x)</span>, which rounds <span class="code">x</span> down to the nearest integer
value that is less than or equal to <span class="code">x</span>.   Even though the return value is
mathematically an integer, it is returned as a value of type <span class="ptype">double</span>, rather than
of type <span class="ptype">int</span> as you might expect.   For example,
<span class="code">Math.floor(3.76)</span> is 3.0, and <span class="code">Math.floor(-4.2)</span> is&nbsp;-5.  
The function <span class="code">Math.round(x)</span> returns
the integer that is closest to <span class="code">x</span>, and <span class="code">Math.ceil(x)</span> rounds <span class="code">x</span>
up to an integer.  ("Ceil" is short for "ceiling", the opposite of "floor.")</li>


<li>
<span class="code">Math.random()</span>, which returns a randomly chosen <span class="ptype">double</span> in
the range <span class="code">0.0 &lt;= Math.random() &lt; 1.0</span>. (The computer actually
calculates so-called "pseudorandom" numbers, which are not truly random but are effectively
random enough for most purposes.)  We will find a lot of uses for <span class="code">Math.random</span>
in future examples.</li>

</ul>


<p>For these functions, the type of the parameter—the <span class="code">x</span> or <span class="code">y</span> inside
the parentheses—can be any value of any numeric type. For most of the functions, the value
returned by the function is of type <span class="ptype">double</span> no matter what the type of
the parameter. However, for <span class="code">Math.abs(x)</span>, the value returned will be
the same type as <span class="code">x</span>; if <span class="code">x</span> is of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, then so is
<span class="code">Math.abs(x)</span>. So, for example, while <span class="code">Math.sqrt(9)</span> is the
<span class="ptype">double</span> value 3.0, <span class="code">Math.abs(9)</span> is the <span class="ptype">int</span> value&nbsp;9.</p>


<p>Note that <span class="code">Math.random()</span> does not have any parameter. You still need
the parentheses, even though there's nothing between them. The parentheses let
the computer know that this is a subroutine rather than a variable. Another
example of a subroutine that has no parameters is the function
<span class="code">System.currentTimeMillis()</span>, from the <span class="classname">System</span> class. When this
function is executed, it retrieves the current time, expressed as the number of
milliseconds that have passed since a standardized base time (the start of the
year 1970, if you care). One millisecond is one-thousandth 
of a second. The return value of <span class="code">System.currentTimeMillis()</span> is of type
<span class="ptype">long</span> (a 64-bit integer). This function can be used to measure the time that it takes the
computer to perform a task. Just record the time at which the task is begun and
the time at which it is finished and take the difference.  For more accurate timing,
you can use <span class="code">System.nanoTime()</span> instead. <span class="code">System.nanoTime()</span>
returns the number of nanoseconds since some arbitrary starting time, where one
nanosecond is one-billionth of a second.  However, you should not expect the
time to be truly accurate to the nanosecond.</p>


<p>Here is a sample program that performs a few mathematical tasks and reports
the time that it takes for the program to run.</p>


<pre>/**
 * This program performs some mathematical computations and displays the
 * results.  It also displays the value of the constant Math.PI.  It then 
 * reports the number of seconds that the computer spent on this task.
 */
public class TimedComputation {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        long startTime; // Starting time of program, in nanoseconds.
        long endTime;   // Time when computations are done, in nanoseconds.
        long compTime;  // Run time in nanoseconds.
        double seconds; // Time difference, in seconds.

        startTime = System.nanoTime();

        double width, height, hypotenuse;  // sides of a triangle
        width = 42.0;
        height = 17.0;
        hypotenuse = Math.sqrt( width*width + height*height );
        System.out.print("A triangle with sides 42 and 17 has hypotenuse ");
        System.out.println(hypotenuse);

        System.out.println("\nMathematically, sin(x)*sin(x) + "
                + "cos(x)*cos(x) - 1 should be 0.");
        System.out.println("Let's check this for x = 100:");
        System.out.print("      sin(100)*sin(100) + cos(100)*cos(100) - 1 is: ");
        System.out.println( Math.sin(100)*Math.sin(100) 
                + Math.cos(100)*Math.cos(100) - 1 );
        System.out.println("(There can be round-off errors when" 
                + " computing with real numbers!)");

        System.out.print("\nHere is a random number:  ");
        System.out.println( Math.random() );

        System.out.print("\nThe value of Math.PI is ");
        System.out.println( Math.PI );

        endTime = System.nanoTime();
        compTime = endTime - startTime;
        seconds = compTime / 1000000000.0;

        System.out.print("\nRun time in nanoseconds was: ");
        System.out.println(compTime);
        System.out.println("(This is probably not perfectly accurate!");
        System.out.print("\nRun time in seconds was:  ");
        System.out.println(seconds);

    } // end main()

} // end class TimedComputation</pre>
