<p>A variable in Java is designed to hold only one particular type of data; it
can legally hold that type of data and no other. The compiler will consider it
to be a syntax error if you try to violate this rule by assigning a value of the
wrong type to a variable. We say that Java is a
<span class="newword">strongly typed</span> language because it enforces this
rule.</p>


<p>There are eight so-called <span class="newword">primitive types</span> built
into Java. The primitive types are named <span class="ptype">byte</span>, <span class="ptype">short</span>,
<span class="ptype">int</span>, <span class="ptype">long</span>, <span class="ptype">float</span>, <span class="ptype">double</span>, <span class="ptype">char</span>,
and <span class="ptype">boolean</span>. The first four types hold integers (whole numbers such as
17, -38477, and 0). The four integer types are distinguished by the ranges of
integers they can hold. The <span class="ptype">float</span> and <span class="ptype">double</span> types hold real
numbers (such as 3.6 and -145.99). Again, the two real types are distinguished
by their range and accuracy. A variable of type <span class="ptype">char</span> holds a single
character from the Unicode character set. And a variable of type
<span class="ptype">boolean</span> holds one of the two logical values <span class="code">true</span> or
<span class="code">false</span>.</p>


<p>Any data value stored in the computer's memory must be represented as a
binary number, that is as a string of zeros and ones. A single zero or one is
called a <span class="newword">bit</span>. A string of eight bits is called a
<span class="newword">byte</span>. Memory is usually measured in terms of
bytes. Not surprisingly, the <span class="ptype">byte</span> data type refers to a single byte of
memory. A variable of type <span class="ptype">byte</span> holds a string of eight bits, which
can represent any of the integers between -128 and 127, inclusive. (There are
256 integers in that range; eight bits can represent 256—two raised to the
power eight—different values.) As for the other integer types,</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="ptype">short</span> corresponds to two bytes (16 bits). Variables of type
<span class="ptype">short</span> have values in the range -32768 to 32767.</li>


<li>
<span class="ptype">int</span> corresponds to four bytes (32 bits). Variables of type
<span class="ptype">int</span> have values in the range -2147483648 to 2147483647.</li>


<li>
<span class="ptype">long</span> corresponds to eight bytes (64 bits). Variables of type
<span class="ptype">long</span> have values in the range -9223372036854775808 to
9223372036854775807.</li>

</ul>


<p>You don't have to remember these numbers, but they do give you some idea of
the size of integers that you can work with. Usually, for representing integer
data you should just stick to
the <span class="ptype">int</span> data type, which is good enough for most purposes.</p>


<p>The <span class="ptype">float</span> data type is represented in four bytes of memory, using a
standard method for encoding real numbers. The maximum value for a
<span class="ptype">float</span> is about 10 raised to the power 38. A <span class="ptype">float</span> can have
about 7 significant digits. (So that 32.3989231134 and 32.3989234399 would both
have to be rounded off to about 32.398923 in order to be stored in a variable
of type <span class="ptype">float</span>.) A <span class="ptype">double</span> takes up 8 bytes, can range up to
about 10 to the power 308, and has about 15 significant digits. Ordinarily, you
should stick to the <span class="ptype">double</span> type for real values.</p>


<p>A variable of type <span class="ptype">char</span> occupies two bytes in memory. The value of
a <span class="ptype">char</span> variable is a single character such as A, *, x, or a space
character. The value can also be a special character such a tab or a carriage
return or one of the many Unicode characters that come from different
languages.  Values of type <span class="ptype">char</span> are closely related to integer
values, since a character is actually stored as a 16-bit integer code number.  In
fact, we will see that <span class="ptype">chars</span> in Java can actually be used like integers in
certain situations.</p>


<p>It is important to remember that a primitive type value is represented using only
a certain, finite number of bits.  So, an <span class="ptype">int</span> can't be an arbitrary integer;
it can only be an integer in a certain finite range of values.  Similarly, <span class="ptype">float</span>
and <span class="ptype">double</span> variables can only take on certain values.  They are not true
real numbers in the mathematical sense.  For example, the mathematical constant π can only
be approximated by a value of type <span class="ptype">float</span> or <span class="ptype">double</span>, since
it would require an infinite number of decimal places to represent it exactly.  For that
matter, many simple numbers such as 1/3 can only be approximated by <span class="ptype">floats</span> and
<span class="ptype">doubles</span>.</p>
