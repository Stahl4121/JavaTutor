</h3>


<p>The most basic output function is <span class="code">System.out.print(x)</span>, where <span class="code">x</span>
can be a value or expression of any type.  If the parameter, <span class="code">x</span>, is not already
a string, it is converted to a value of type <span class="classname">String</span>, and the string 
is then output to the destination called <span class="newword">standard output</span>.  (Generally,
this means that the string is displayed to the user; however, in GUI programs, it
outputs to a place where a typical user is unlikely to see it.  Furthermore, standard
output can be "redirected" to write to a different output destination.  Nevertheless,
for the type of program that we are working with now, the purpose of <span class="code">System.out</span> 
is to display text to the user.)</p>


<p>
<span class="code">System.out.println(x)</span> outputs the same text as <span class="code">System.out.print</span>,
but it follows that text by a line feed, which means that any subsequent output will be on the
next line.  It is possible to use this function with no parameter, <span class="code">System.out.println()</span>,
which outputs nothing but a line feed.  Note that <span class="code">System.out.println(x)</span> is equivalent
to</p>


<pre>System.out.print(x);
System.out.println();</pre>
 

<p>You might have noticed that <span class="code">System.out.print</span> outputs real numbers with
as many digits after the decimal point as necessary, so that for example π is output 
as 3.141592653589793, and numbers that are supposed to represent money might be output
as 1050.0 or 43.575.  You might prefer to have these numbers output as, for example,
3.14159, 1050.00, and 43.58.
Java has a "formatted output" capability that makes it easy
to control how real numbers and other values are printed.  A lot of formatting options
are available.  I will cover just a few of the simplest and most commonly used
possibilities here.</p>
   

<p>The function <span class="code">System.out.printf</span> can be used to produce formatted
output.  (The name "printf," which stands for "print formatted," is copied from
the C and C++ programming languages, where this type of output originated.)
<span class="code">System.out.printf</span> takes one or more parameters.
The first parameter is a <span class="classname">String</span> that specifies the format of the
output.  This parameter is called the <span class="newword">format string</span>.
The remaining parameters specify the values that are to be output.  Here is
a statement that will print a number in the proper format for a dollar amount,
where <span class="code">amount</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">double</span>:
</p>
   

<pre>System.out.printf( "%1.2f", amount );</pre>
   
   

<p>The output format for a value is give by a <span class="newword">format specifier</span> in the format string.
In this example, the format specifier is <span class="code">%1.2f</span>.
The format string (in the simple cases that I cover here) contains one format specifier for
each of the values that is to be output.  Some typical format specifiers are 
<span class="code">%d</span>, <span class="code">%12d</span>, <span class="code">%10s</span>, <span class="code">%1.2f</span>, <span class="code">%15.8e</span> and <span class="code">%1.8g</span>.
Every format specifier begins with a percent sign (<span class="code">%</span>) and ends with a letter, possibly with
some extra formatting information in between.  The letter specifies the type of output
that is to be produced.  For example, in <span class="code">%d</span> and <span class="code">%12d</span>,
the "d" specifies that an integer is to be written.  The "12" in <span class="code">%12d</span>
specifies the minimum number of spaces that should be used for the output.  If the
integer that is being output takes up fewer than 12 spaces, extra blank spaces
are added in front of the integer to bring the total up to 12.  We say that the
output is "right-justified in a field of length 12."  A very large value is not forced into
12 spaces; if the value has more than 12 digits, all the digits will be printed, with
no extra spaces.  The specifier <span class="code">%d</span> means the same as <span class="code">%1d</span>—that is, 
an integer will be printed using just as many spaces as necessary.
(The "d," by the way, stands for "decimal"—that is, base-10—numbers.  You can replace the "d" with an "x" to
output an integer value in hexadecimal form.)
</p>
   

<p>The letter "s" at the end of a format specifier can be used with any type of value.
It means that the value should be output in its default format, just as it would be
in unformatted output.  A number, such as the "20" in <span class="code">%20s</span>, can
be added to specify the (minimum) number of characters.  The "s" stands for "string,"
and it can be used for values of type <span class="classname">String</span>.  It can also be used
for values of other types; in that case the value is converted into a <span class="classname">String</span> 
value in the usual way.</p>
   

<p>The format specifiers for values of type <span class="ptype">double</span> are more complicated.
An "f", as in <span class="code">%1.2f</span>, is used to output a number in "floating-point" form,
that is with digits after a decimal point.  In <span class="code">%1.2f</span>, the "2" specifies
the number of digits to use after the decimal point.  The "1" specifies the (minimum)
number of characters to output; a "1" in this position effectively means that just as many characters
as are necessary should be used.  Similarly, <span class="code">%12.3f</span> would specify a
floating-point format with 3 digits after the decimal point, right-justified in a
field of length 12.</p>
   

<p>Very large and very small numbers should be written in exponential format, such
as 6.00221415e23, representing "6.00221415 times 10 raised to the power 23."
A format specifier such as <span class="code">%15.8e</span> specifies an output in exponential
form, with the "8" telling how many digits to use after the decimal point.
If you use "g" instead of "e", the output will be in exponential form for
very small values and very large values and in floating-point form for other values.  In <span class="code">%1.8g</span>,
the 8 gives the total number of digits in the answer, including both the
digits before the decimal point and the digits after the decimal point.</p>


<p>For numeric output, the format specifier can include a comma&nbsp;(","), 
which will cause the digits of the number to be separated into groups, to
make it easier to read big numbers.  In the United States, groups of three
digits are separated by commas.  For example, if <span class="code">x</span> is one billion,
then <span class="code">System.out.printf("%,d",x)</span> will output 1,000,000,000.
In other countries, the separator character and the
number of digits per group might be different.  The comma should come at the
beginning of the format specifier, before the field width; for example: 
<span class="code">%,12.3f</span>.  If you want the output to be left-justified instead of
right justified, add a minus sign to the beginning of the format specifier:
for example, <span class="code">%-20s</span>.
</p>
   

<p>In addition to format specifiers, the format string in a <span class="code">printf</span> statement
can include other characters.  These extra characters are just copied to the
output.  This can be a convenient way to insert values into the middle of an
output string.  For example, if <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are variables
of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, you could say</p>
   

<pre>System.out.printf("The product of %d and %d is %d", x, y, x*y);</pre>
   

<p>When this statement is executed, the value of <span class="code">x</span> is substituted for the
first <span class="code">%d</span> in the string, the value of <span class="code">y</span> for the second
<span class="code">%d</span>, and the value of the expression <span class="code">x*y</span> for the third,
so the output would be something like "The product of 17 and 42 is 714" (quotation
marks not included in output!).
</p>


<p>To output a percent sign, use the format specifier <span class="code">%%</span> in the format 
string.  You can use <span class="code">%n</span> to output a line feed.  You can also use
a backslash, <span class="code">\</span>, as usual in strings to output special characters
such as tabs and double quote characters.</p>
