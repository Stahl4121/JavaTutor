</h3>


<p>A data value is stored in the computer as a sequence of bits.  In the computer's
memory, it doesn't look anything like a value written on this page.  You need a
way to include constant values in the programs that you write.  In a program, you represent constant values
as <span class="newword">literals</span>.  A literal is something that you can type in a program to
represent a value.  It is a kind of name for a constant value.</p>


<p>For example, to type a value of type <span class="ptype">char</span> in a program, you must surround it with
a pair of single quote marks, such as <span class="code">'A'</span>, <span class="code">'*'</span>, or <span class="code">'x'</span>.
The character and the quote marks make up a literal of type <span class="ptype">char</span>.
Without the quotes, <span class="code">A</span> would be an
identifier and <span class="code">*</span> would be a multiplication operator. The quotes are <b>not</b> part of
the value and are not stored in the variable; they are just a convention for
naming a particular character constant in a program.  If you want to store the character A in
a variable <span class="code">ch</span> of type <span class="ptype">char</span>, you could do so with the assignment
statement</p>


<pre>ch = 'A';</pre>


<p>Certain special characters have special literals
that use a backslash, <span class="code">\</span>, as an "escape character." In particular, a tab is
represented as <span class="code">'\t'</span>, a carriage return as <span class="code">'\r'</span>, a linefeed as
<span class="code">'\n'</span>, the single quote character as <span class="code">'\''</span>, and the backslash
itself as <span class="code">'\\'</span>. Note that even though you type two characters between
the quotes in <span class="code">'\t'</span>, the value represented by this literal is a single
tab character.</p>


<p>Numeric literals are a little more complicated than you might expect. Of
course, there are the obvious literals such as 317 and 17.42. But there are
other possibilities for expressing numbers in a Java program. First of all,
real numbers can be represented in an exponential form such as 1.3e12 or
12.3737e-108. The "e12" and "e-108" represent powers of 10, so that 1.3e12
means 1.3 times 10<sup>12</sup> and 12.3737e-108 means 12.3737 times
10<sup>-108</sup>. This format can be used to express very large and very small numbers.
Any numeric literal that contains a decimal point or exponential is a literal
of type <span class="ptype">double</span>. To make a literal of type <span class="ptype">float</span>, you have to
append an "F" or "f" to the end of the number. For example, "1.2F" stands for
1.2 considered as a value of type <span class="ptype">float</span>. (Occasionally, you need to
know this because the rules of Java say that you can't assign a value of type
<span class="ptype">double</span> to a variable of type <span class="ptype">float</span>, so you might be
confronted with a ridiculous-seeming error message if you try to do something
like "<span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.2;</span>" if <span class="code">x</span> is a variable of type
<span class="ptype">float</span>. You have to say "<span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.2F;"</span>.
This is one reason why I advise sticking to type <span class="ptype">double</span> for real
numbers.)</p>


<p>Even for integer literals, there are some complications. Ordinary integers
such as 177777 and -32 are literals of type <span class="ptype">byte</span>, <span class="ptype">short</span>, or
<span class="ptype">int</span>, depending on their size. You can make a literal of type
<span class="ptype">long</span> by adding "L" as a suffix. For example: 17L or 728476874368L. As
another complication, Java allows binary, octal (base-8), and hexadecimal (base-16)
literals. I don't want to cover number bases in detail, but in case
you run into them in other people's programs, it's worth knowing a few things:
Octal numbers use only the digits 0 through 7.  In Java, a numeric literal
that begins with a 0 is interpreted as an octal number; for example, the octal
literal 045 represents the number 37, not the number 45.  Octal numbers are rarely
used, but you need to be aware of what happens when you start a number with a zero.
Hexadecimal numbers use 16 digits, the usual digits 0 through 9 and the letters
A, B, C, D, E, and F.  Upper case and lower case letters can be used
interchangeably in this context.  The letters represent the numbers 10 through 15.
In Java, a hexadecimal literal begins with <span class="code">0x</span> or <span class="code">0X</span>,
as in <span class="code">0x45</span> or <span class="code">0xFF7A</span>.  Finally, binary literals
start with <span class="code">0b</span> or <span class="code">0B</span> and contain only the digits
0 and&nbsp;1; for example: 0b10110.</p>


<p>As a final complication, numeric
literals can include the underscore character&nbsp;("<span class="code">_</span>"), which
can be used to separate groups of digits.  For example, the integer constant
for two billion could be written 2_000_000_000, which is a good deal easier to decipher
than 2000000000.  There is no rule about how many digits have to be in each group.
Underscores can be especially useful in long binary numbers; for example,
<span class="code">0b1010_1100_1011</span>.</p>


<p>I will note that hexadecimal numbers can also be used in character literals to represent
arbitrary Unicode characters.  A Unicode literal consists of <span class="code">\u</span> followed
by four hexadecimal digits.  For example, the character literal <span class="code">'\u00E9'</span>
represents the Unicode character that is an "e" with an acute accent.
</p>


<p>For the type <span class="ptype">boolean</span>, there are precisely two literals:
<span class="code">true</span> and <span class="code">false</span>. These literals are typed just as I've written
them here, without quotes, but they represent values, not variables. Boolean
values occur most often as the values of conditional expressions. For
example,</p>


<pre>rate &gt; 0.05</pre>
   

<p>is a boolean-valued expression that evaluates to <span class="code">true</span> if the value
of the variable <span class="code">rate</span> is greater than 0.05, and to <span class="code">false</span> if
the value of <span class="code">rate</span> is less than or equal to 0.05. As you'll see in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c3/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>, 
boolean-valued expressions are used
extensively in control structures. Of course, boolean values can also be
assigned to variables of type <span class="ptype">boolean</span>.  For example, if <span class="code">test</span> is 
a variable of type <span class="ptype">boolean</span>, then both of the following assignment statements
are legal:</p>


<pre>test = true;
test = rate &gt; 0.05;</pre>
