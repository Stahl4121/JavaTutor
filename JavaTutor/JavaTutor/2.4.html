<a name="basics.2.1">2.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Variables</a>
</h3>


<p>Programs manipulate data that are stored in memory. In machine language,
data can only be referred to by giving the numerical address of the location in
memory where the data is stored. In a high-level language such as Java, names are
used instead of numbers to refer to data. It is the job of the computer to keep
track of where in memory the data is actually stored; the programmer only has
to remember the name. A name used in this way—to refer to data stored in
memory—is called a <span class="newword">variable</span>.</p>


<p>Variables are actually rather subtle. Properly speaking, a variable is not a
name for the data itself but for a location in memory that can hold data. You
should think of a variable as a container or box where you can store data that
you will need to use later. The variable refers directly to the box and only
indirectly to the data in the box. Since the data in the box can change, a
variable can refer to different data values at different times during the
execution of the program, but it always refers to the same box. Confusion can
arise, especially for beginning programmers, because when a variable is used in
a program in certain ways, it refers to the container, but when it is used in
other ways, it refers to the data in the container. You'll see examples of both
cases below.</p>


<p>In Java, the <b>only</b> way to get data into a variable—that
is, into the box that the variable names—is with an <span class="newword">assignment statement</span>. 
An assignment statement takes the
form:</p>


<pre><span class="bnf">variable</span> = <span class="bnf">expression</span>;</pre>


<p>where <span class="bnf">expression</span> represents anything that
refers to or computes a data value. When the computer comes to an assignment
statement in the course of executing a program, it evaluates the expression and
puts the resulting data value into the variable. For example, consider the
simple assignment statement</p>


<pre>rate = 0.07;</pre>


<p>The <span class="bnf">variable</span> in this assignment statement is
<span class="code">rate</span>, and the <span class="bnf">expression</span> is the number
0.07. The computer executes this assignment statement by putting the number
0.07 in the variable <span class="code">rate</span>, replacing whatever was there before. Now,
consider the following more complicated assignment statement, which might come
later in the same program:</p>


<pre>interest = rate * principal;</pre>


<p>Here, the value of the expression "<span class="code">rate * principal</span>" is being
assigned to the variable <span class="code">interest</span>. In the expression, the <span class="code">*</span>
is a "multiplication operator" that tells the computer to multiply
<span class="code">rate</span> times <span class="code">principal</span>. The names <span class="code">rate</span> and
<span class="code">principal</span> are themselves variables, and it is really the
<b>values</b> stored in those variables that are to be multiplied. We
see that when a variable is used in an expression, it is the value stored in
the variable that matters; in this case, the variable seems to refer to the
data in the box, rather than to the box itself. When the computer executes this
assignment statement, it takes the <b>value</b> of <span class="code">rate</span>,
multiplies it by the <b>value</b> of <span class="code">principal</span>, and stores
the answer in the <b>box</b> referred to by <span class="code">interest</span>.
When a variable is used on the left-hand side of an assignment statement,
it refers to the box that is named by the variable.</p>


<p>(Note, by the way, that an assignment statement is a command that is
executed by the computer at a certain time. It is not a statement of fact. For
example, suppose a program includes the statement "<span class="code">rate = 0.07;</span>". If
the statement "<span class="code">interest = rate * principal;</span>" is executed later in the
program, can we say that the <span class="code">principal</span> is multiplied by 0.07? No! The
value of <span class="code">rate</span> might have been changed in the meantime by another
statement. The meaning of an assignment statement is completely different from
the meaning of an equation in mathematics, even though both use the symbol&nbsp;"=".)</p>

<a name="basics.2.5">2.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Variables in Programs</a>
</h3>


<p>A variable can be used in a program only if it has first been <span class="newword">declared</span>. 
A <span class="newword">variable declaration statement</span> is used to declare one or more variables and to give them
names. When the computer executes a variable declaration, it sets aside memory
for the variable and associates the variable's name with that memory. A simple
variable declaration takes the form:</p>


<pre><span class="bnf">type-name</span>  <span class="bnf">variable-name-or-names</span>;</pre>
   

<p>The <span class="bnf">variable-name-or-names</span> can be a single
variable name or a list of variable names separated by commas. (We'll see later
that variable declaration statements can actually be somewhat more complicated
than this.) Good programming style is to declare only one variable in a
declaration statement, unless the variables are closely related in some way.
For example:</p>


<pre>int numberOfStudents;
String name;
double x, y;        
boolean isFinished;
char firstInitial, middleInitial, lastInitial;</pre>
   

<p>It is also good style to include a comment with each variable declaration to
explain its purpose in the program, or to give other information that might
be useful to a human reader.  For example:</p>
   

<pre>double principal;    // Amount of money invested.
double interestRate; // Rate as a decimal, not percentage.</pre>


<p>In this chapter, we will only use variables declared inside the
<span class="code">main()</span> subroutine of a program. Variables declared inside a subroutine
are called <span class="newword">local variables</span> for that subroutine.
They exist only inside the subroutine, while it is running, and are completely
inaccessible from outside. Variable declarations can occur anywhere inside the
subroutine, as long as each variable is declared before it is used in any
way. Some people like to declare all the variables at the beginning of
the subroutine. Others like to wait to declare a variable until it is needed.
My preference: Declare important variables at the beginning of the subroutine,
and use a comment to explain the purpose of each variable. Declare "utility
variables" which are not important to the overall logic of the subroutine at
the point in the subroutine where they are first used. Here is a simple program
using some variables and assignment statements:</p>


<pre>/**
 * This class implements a simple program that
 * will compute the amount of interest that is
 * earned on $17,000 invested at an interest
 * rate of 0.027 for one year.  The interest and
 * the value of the investment after one year are
 * printed to standard output.
 */
 
public class Interest {
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
       /* Declare the variables. */
   
       double principal;     // The value of the investment.
       double rate;          // The annual interest rate.
       double interest;      // Interest earned in one year.
       
       /* Do the computations. */
       
       principal = 17000;
       rate = 0.027;
       interest = principal * rate;   // Compute the interest.
       
       principal = principal + interest;
             // Compute value of investment after one year, with interest.
             // (Note: The new value replaces the old value of principal.)
             
       /* Output the results. */
             
       System.out.print("The interest earned is $");
       System.out.println(interest);
       System.out.print("The value of the investment after one year is $");
       System.out.println(principal);
                      
   } // end of main()
      
} // end of class Interest</pre>



<p>This program uses several subroutine call statements to display information
to the user of the program. Two different subroutines are used:
<span class="code">System.out.print</span> and <span class="code">System.out.println</span>. The difference
between these is that <span class="code">System.out.println</span> adds a linefeed after
the end of the information that it displays, while <span class="code">System.out.print</span>
does not. Thus, the value of <span class="code">interest</span>, which is displayed by the
subroutine call "<span class="code">System.out.println(interest);</span>", follows on the same
line as the string displayed by the previous <span class="code">System.out.print</span> statement. Note that the value
to be displayed by <span class="code">System.out.print</span> or <span class="code">System.out.println</span> is
provided in parentheses after the subroutine name. This value is called a
<span class="newword">parameter</span> to the subroutine. A parameter provides
a subroutine with information it needs to perform its task. In a subroutine
call statement, any parameters are listed in parentheses after the subroutine
name. Not all subroutines have parameters. If there are no parameters in a
subroutine call statement, the subroutine name must be followed by an empty
pair of parentheses.</p>
