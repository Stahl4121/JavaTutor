<span class="start"><big>A</big>lthough the Java language</span> is highly
standardized, the procedures for creating, compiling, and editing Java programs
vary widely from one programming environment to another.  There are two
basic approaches: a <span class="newword">command line environment</span>,
where the user types commands and the computer responds,
and an <span class="newword">integrated development environment</span> (IDE),
where the user uses the keyboard and mouse to interact with a graphical user 
interface.  While there is just one common command line environment for Java
programming, there are several common IDEs, including Eclipse, NetBeans,
and BlueJ.</a>.)</p>


<p>One thing to keep in mind is that you do not have to pay any money
to do Java programming (aside from buying a computer, of course).  Everything
that you need can be downloaded for free on the Internet.
</p>


<p>This textbook covers Java 8, but at the time of its release, the current version of
Java is Java&nbsp;11.  Significant changes both in the Java language and in the
Oracle corporation's policies concerning Java have been made.</a></p>

<a name="basics.6.1">2.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Java Development Kit</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The basic development system for Java programming is usually referred
to as a <span class="newword">JDK</span> (Java Development Kit).  It is a part of Java&nbsp;SE,
the Java "Standard Edition."  Note that the Java&nbsp;8 Standard Edition comes in 
two versions, a Development Kit version (the JDK) and a Runtime Environment version
(the JRE).  The Runtime can be used to run Java programs,
but it does not allow you to compile your own Java programs.
The Development Kit includes the Runtime but also
lets you compile programs.  You need a JDK for use with this textbook.
</p>


<p>If a JDK is properly installed on your computer, you can use the command line environment
to compile and run Java programs. An IDE will also require a JDK, but it might be included with
the IDE download.</p>
   

<p>Java was developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc., which was acquired by the Oracle corporation. 
Oracle makes JDK&nbsp;8 for Windows, Mac&nbsp;OS, and Linux
available for free download at its Java Web site.  (For Linux, a version of the JDK known as
OpenJDK is often included on the installation media.  Note that when using OpenJDK,
you will also need to install OpenJFX to get support for programs that use JavaFX.)
Some computers might come with
a Java Runtime already installed, but you will probably need to install the JDK in any case.
</p>


<p>You will need a JDK for Java 8 or later for use with this textbook.
Although a JDK for Java&nbsp;11 is also available at the Oracle site, it is mainly meant
for commercial use.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.6.3">2.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Eclipse</a>
</h3>
   

<p>In an Integrated Development Environment, everything you need to create, compile, and
run programs is integrated into a single package, with a graphical user interface
that will be familiar to most computer users.  There are a number of different IDEs for Java program
development, ranging from fairly simple wrappers around the JDK to highly complex
applications with a multitude of features.  For a beginning programmer, there is a danger
in using an IDE, since the difficulty of learning to use the IDE, on top of the
difficulty of learning to program, can be overwhelming.  However, for my own programming,
I generally use the <span class="newword">Eclipse</span> IDE, and I introduce my students to it
after they have had some experience with the command line.  I will discuss Eclipse in
some detail and two other IDEs, NetBeans and BlueJ, in much less detail.
All of these IDEs have features that are very useful even
for a beginning programmer, although a beginner will want to ignore many of their
advanced features.</p>
   

<p>You can download an Eclipse IDE from <a href="http://eclipse.org/">eclipse.org</a>.  It is a
free program.  Eclipse is itself written in Java.  It requires a Java Runtime Environment, 
but not necessarily a JDK, since it includes its own compiler.  To use Eclipse with Java&nbsp;8,
you should make sure that the JRE or JDK, Version 8 or higher, is installed on your computer, as
described <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c2/s6.html#basics.6.1">above</a>, <b>before</b> you install Eclipse.
There are several versions of the Eclipse IDE; you can use the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers."
</p>
      

<p>The first time you start Eclipse, you will be asked to specify a <span class="newword">workspace</span>,
which is the directory where all your work will be stored.  You can accept the default name, or
provide one of your own.  When startup is complete, the Eclipse window will be filled by a large 
"Welcome" screen that includes links to extensive documentation and tutorials.  You should close this screen, by
clicking the "X" next to the word "Welcome"; you can get back to it later by choosing "Welcome"
from the "Help" menu.</p>


<p>The Eclipse GUI consists of one large window that is divided into several sections.  Each section
contains one or more <span class="newword">views</span>.  For example, a view can be a text editor, it can be a place where
a program can do I/O, or it can contain a list of all your projects.
If there are several views in one section of the window,
then there will be tabs at the top of the section to select the view that is displayed in that
section.  Each view displays a different type of information.  The whole set of views is called
a <span class="newword">perspective</span>.  Eclipse uses different perspectives, that is, different
sets of views of different types of information, for different tasks.  For compiling and
running programs, the only perspective that you will need is the "Java Perspective,"
which is the default.  As you become more experienced, you might want to the use
the "Debug Perspective," which has features designed to help you find semantic errors in programs.</p>


<p>The Java Perspective includes a large area in the center of the window
that contains text editor views.  This is where you will create and edit your programs.
To the left of this is the
Package Explorer view, which will contain a list of your Java projects and source code
files.  To the right are some other views that I don't find very useful; 
I suggest that you close them by clicking the small "X" next to the name of each one.
Several other views that <b>will</b>
be useful appear in a section of the window
below the editing area.  If you accidently close one of the important views, such as the
Package Explorer, you can get it back by selecting it from the "Show View" submenu
of the "Window" menu.  You can also reset the whole window to its default contents by
selecting "Reset Perspective" from the "Window" menu.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>To do any work in Eclipse, you need a <span class="newword">project</span>.  To start
a Java project, go to the "New" submenu in the "File" menu, and select the "Java Project" command.
In the window that pops up, it is only necessary to fill in a "Project Name" for
the project and click the "Finish" button.  The project name can be anything you like.
The project should appear in the
"Package Explorer" view.  Click on the small triangle or plus sign next to the project name to see the
contents of the project.  Assuming that you use the default settings, there should be
a directory named "src," which is where your Java source code files will go.  It also 
contains the "JRE System Library"; this is the collection of standard built-in classes 
that come with Java.</p>


<p>Once a Java program is in the project, you can open it in an editor by right-clicking the
file name in the "Package Explorer" view.  To run the program,
right-click in the editor window, or on the file name in
the Package Explorer view (or control-click in Mac&nbsp;OS).  In the menu that pops
up, go to the "Run As" submenu, and select "Java Application".  The program
will be executed.  If the program writes to standard output, the output will
appear in the "Console" view, in the area of the Eclipse window below the editing area.  If the program uses
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> or <span class="classname">Scanner</span> for input, you will have to type the required input into
the "Console" view&mdash;<b>click the "Console" view before you start typing</b>, so that
the characters that you type will be sent to the correct part of the window.
(For an easier way to run a program, find and click the small "Run" button in Eclipse's tool bar.)
Note that when you run a program in Eclipse, it is compiled automatically.  There is
no separate compilation step.
</p>


<p>To create a new Java program in Eclipse, you must create a new Java class.
To do that, right-click the Java project name in the "Project Explorer" view.
Go to the "New" submenu of the popup menu, and select "Class".  (Alternatively,
there is a small icon in the toolbar at the top of the Eclipse window that you can click to
create a new Java class.)  In the
window that opens, type in the name of the class that you want to create.
The class name must be a legal Java identifier.
Note that you want the name of the class, not the name of the
source code file, so don't add ".java" at the end of the name.  
The window also includes an input box labeled "Package" where you can 
specify the name of a package to contain the class.
Most examples in this book use the "default package," but you can create your
own programs in any package.  To use the default package, the "Package"
input box should be empty.  Finally, click the "Finish" button to create the class.  The class
should appear inside the "src" folder, in a folder corresponding to its package.  The new file
should automatically open in the editing area so that you can start typing in your program.</p>
   

<p>Eclipse has several features that aid you as you type your code.
It will underline any syntax error with a jagged red line, and in some
cases will place an error marker in the left border of the edit window.
If you hover the mouse cursor over the error marker or over the error itself, 
a description of
the error will appear.  Note that you do not have to get rid of every
error immediately as you type; some errors will go away as you type
in more of the program.  If an error marker displays a small "light
bulb," Eclipse is offering to try to fix the error for you.  Click
the light bulb—or simply hover your mouse over the actual error—to 
get a list of possible fixes, then click
the fix that you want to apply.  For example, if you use an undeclared
variable in your program, Eclipse will offer to declare it for you.
You can actually use this error-correcting feature to get Eclipse
to write certain types of code for you!
Unfortunately, you'll find that you won't understand a lot of the
proposed fixes until you learn more about the Java language, and
it is <b>not</b> a good idea to apply a fix that you don't
understand—often that will just make things worse in the
end.</p>
  

<p>Eclipse will also look for spelling errors in comments and will underline
them with jagged red lines.  Hover your mouse over the error to get
a list of possible correct spellings.</p>
   

<p>Another essential Eclipse feature is <span class="newword">content assist</span>.
Content assist can be invoked by typing Control-Space.  It will offer possible
completions of whatever you are typing at the moment.  For example,
if you type part of an identifier and hit Control-Space, you will get
a list of identifiers that start with the characters that you have typed;
use the up and down arrow keys to select one of the items in the list, and
press Return or Enter.  (You can also click an item with the mouse to select it, 
or hit Escape to dismiss the list.)  If there is
only one possible completion when you hit Control-Space, it will be
inserted automatically.  By default, Content Assist will also pop up automatically,
after a short delay, when you type a period or certain other characters.</p>
   

<p>Once you have an error-free program, you can run it as described above.
If you find a problem when you run it, it's very
easy to go back to the editor, make changes, and run it again.</p>

<p>
<b>About JavaFX and Eclipse:</b> Eclipse will work with JavaFX,
the GUI toolkit that is used in this textbook.  However, you might
want to install a plugin named <span class="code">efxclipse</span> for better
support.  See
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/index.html">www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/</a>
for information.  If, like me, you are using Eclipse with OpenJDK&nbsp;8 and OpenJFX,
you might get an error when you try to use OpenJFX classes and methods.
This is because OpenJFX is installed as an "extension," and Eclipse doesn't
like to run extension code.  To get rid of the errors, open the Eclipse
preferences dialog, go to "Java" / "Compiler" / "Errors and Warnings".
Under "Errors and Warnings" / "Deprecated and restricted API", set
"Forbidden reference (access rule)" to "Ignore".</p>
