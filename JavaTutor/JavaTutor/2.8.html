</h3>


<p>For some unfathomable reason, Java 
has traditionally made it difficult to read data typed in by the user of a program.
You've already seen that output can be displayed to the user using the
subroutine <span class="code">System.out.print</span>. This subroutine is part of a predefined
object called <span class="code">System.out</span>. The purpose of this object is precisely to
display output to the user.  There is a corresponding object called
<span class="code">System.in</span> that exists to read data input by the user, but it provides
only very primitive input facilities, and it requires some advanced Java
programming skills to use it effectively.</p>


<p>Java 5.0 finally made input a little easier with a
new <span class="classname">Scanner</span> class. However, it requires some knowledge of
object-oriented programming to use this class, so it's not ideal for use
here at the beginning of this course.  Java&nbsp;6 introduced the <span class="classname">Console</span>
class for communicating with the user, but <span class="classname">Console</span>
has its own problems. (It is not always available, and it can only read
strings, not numbers.)  Furthermore, in my opinion,
<span class="classname">Scanner</span> and <span class="classname">Console</span> still don't get things quite right.
Nevertheless, I will introduce <span class="classname">Scanner</span> briefly at the end of this
section, in case you want to start using it now.  However, we start with my own version
of text input.</p>


<p>Fortunately, it is possible to <b>extend</b> Java by
creating new classes that provide subroutines that are not available in the
standard part of the language. As soon as a new class is
available, the subroutines that it contains can be used in exactly the same way
as built-in routines.  Along these lines, I've written a class named <span class="classname">TextIO</span> that defines
subroutines for reading values typed by the user. The subroutines in this class
make it possible to get input from the standard input object,
<span class="code">System.in</span>, without knowing about the advanced aspects of Java that are
needed to use <span class="classname">Scanner</span>
or to use <span class="code">System.in</span> directly.</p>


<p>
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> is defined in a "package" named <span class="classname">textio</span>.
This means that when you look for the file <span class="code">TextIO.java</span>, you will find it inside
a folder named <span class="classname">textio</span>.  Furthermore, it means that a program that uses
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> must "import" it from the <span class="classname">textio</span> package.
This is done with the import directive 
</p>


<pre>import textio.TextIO;</pre>


<p>This directive must come before the "public class" that begins your program.  Most of
Java's standard classes are defined in packages and are imported into programs in the same way.</p>


<p>To use the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class, you must make sure that the class is
available to your program. What this means depends on the Java programming
environment that you are using.  In general, you just have to
add the folder <span class="sourceref"><a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/source/chapter2/textio">textio</a></span> to the same folder that contains
your main program.  This folder contains the file <span class="sourceref"><a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/source/chapter2/textio/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span>.
See <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c2/s6.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a> for information about how to use <span class="classname">TextIO</span>.</p>


<p>The input routines in the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class are static member functions.
(Static member functions were introduced in the <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c2/s3.html">previous section</a>.) 
Let's suppose that you want your program to read an integer typed
in by the user. The <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class contains a static member function
named <span class="code">getlnInt</span> that you can use for this purpose. Since this function is
contained in the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class, you have to refer to it in your program
as <span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt</span>. The function has no parameters, so a complete call to the
function takes the form "<span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt()</span>". This function call
represents the <span class="ptype">int</span> value typed by the user, and you have to do
something with the returned value, such as assign it to a variable. For
example, if <span class="code">userInput</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span> (created with
a declaration statement "<span class="code">int&nbsp;userInput;</span>"), then you could use the
assignment statement</p>


<pre>userInput = TextIO.getlnInt();</pre>


<p>When the computer executes this statement, it will wait for the user to type
in an integer value. The user must type a number and press return before the program can
continue.  The value that the user typed will then be returned by the function, and it
will be stored in the variable, <span class="code">userInput</span>. Here is a complete program
that uses <span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt</span> to read a number typed by the user and then
prints out the square of that number.  Note the <span class="code">import</span> directive on the
first line:</p>


<pre>import textio.TextIO;

/**
 * A program that reads an integer that is typed in by the
 * user and computes and prints the square of that integer.
 */ 
public class PrintSquare {
    
     public static void main(String[] args) {
 
        int userInput;  // The number input by the user.
        int square;     // The userInput, multiplied by itself.
        
        System.out.print("Please type a number: ");
        userInput = TextIO.getlnInt();
        square = userInput * userInput;

        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("The number that you entered was " + userInput);
        System.out.println("The square of that number is " + square);
        System.out.println();
        
     } // end of main()
  
} //end of class PrintSquare</pre>


<p>When you run this program, it
will display the message "Please type a number:" and will pause until you type
a response, including a carriage return after the number.  Note that it is
good style to output a question or some other prompt to the user before reading
input.  Otherwise, the user will have no way of knowing exactly what the 
computer is waiting for, or even that it is waiting for the user to do something.

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.4.3">2.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic TextIO Input Functions</a>
</h3>



<p>
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> includes a variety of functions for inputting values
of various types.  Here are the functions that you are
most likely to use:</p>


<pre>j = TextIO.getlnInt();     // Reads a value of type int.
y = TextIO.getlnDouble();  // Reads a value of type double.
a = TextIO.getlnBoolean(); // Reads a value of type boolean.
c = TextIO.getlnChar();    // Reads a value of type char.
w = TextIO.getlnWord();    // Reads one "word" as a value of type String.
s = TextIO.getln();        // Reads an entire input line as a String.</pre>


<p>For these statements to be legal, the variables on the left side of each
assignment statement must already be declared and must be of the same type as 
that returned by the function on the right side.  Note carefully that
these functions do not have parameters.  The values that they return come
from outside the program, typed in by the user as the program is running.
To "capture" that data so that you can use it in your program, you have
to assign the return value of the function to a variable.  You will then
be able to refer to the user's input value by using the name of the variable.</p>


<p>When you call one of these functions, you are guaranteed that it will return
a legal value of the correct type. If the user types in an illegal value as
input—for example, if you ask for an <span class="ptype">int</span> and the user types in a
non-numeric character or a
number that is outside the legal range of values that can be stored
in a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span>—then the computer will
ask the user to re-enter the value, and your program never sees the first,
illegal value that the user entered.  For <span class="code">TextIO.getlnBoolean()</span>,
the user is allowed to type in any of the following: true, false, t, f, yes, no, y,
n, 1, or 0.  Furthermore, they can use either upper or lower case letters.
In any case, the user's input is interpreted as a true/false value.  It's
convenient to use <span class="code">TextIO.getlnBoolean()</span> to read the user's
response to a Yes/No question.</p>


<p>You'll notice that there are two input functions that return Strings. The
first, <span class="code">getlnWord()</span>, returns a string consisting of non-blank characters
only. When it is called, it skips over any spaces and carriage returns typed in
by the user. Then it reads non-blank characters until it gets to the next space
or carriage return. It returns a <span class="classname">String</span> consisting of all the
non-blank characters that it has read. The second input function,
<span class="code">getln()</span>, simply returns a string consisting of all the characters
typed in by the user, including spaces, up to the next carriage return. It gets
an entire line of input text. The carriage return itself is not returned as
part of the input string, but it is read and discarded by the computer. Note
that the String returned by <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> might be the <span class="newword">empty string</span>, 
<span class="code">""</span>, which contains no characters at
all.  You will get this return value if the user simply presses return, without
typing anything else first.</p>


<p>
<span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> does <b>not</b> skip blanks
or end-of-lines before reading a value.  But the input functions <span class="code">getlnInt()</span>, 
<span class="code">getlnDouble()</span>, <span class="code">getlnBoolean()</span>, and
<span class="code">getlnChar()</span> behave like <span class="code">getlnWord()</span> in that they will skip
past any blanks and carriage returns in the input before reading a value.  When one
of these functions skips over an end-of-line, it outputs a '?' to let the user know
that more input is expected.</p>


<p>Furthermore, if the user types extra characters on the line after the
input value, <b>all the extra characters will be discarded, along with
the carriage return at the end of the line</b>.  If the
program executes another input function, the user will have to type in
another line of input, even if they had typed more than one value on the previous line.  
It might not sound like a good idea to discard any
of the user's input, but it turns out to be the safest thing to do in most
programs.</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Using <span class="classname">TextIO</span> for input and output, we can now improve the program
from <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c2/s2.html">Section&nbsp;2.2</a> for computing the value of an investment.
We can have the user type in the initial value of the investment and the
interest rate. The result is a much more useful program—for one thing, it
makes sense to run it more than once!  Note that this program uses formatted
output to print out monetary values in their correct format.</p>


<pre>import textio.TextIO;

/**
 * This class implements a simple program that will compute
 * the amount of interest that is earned on an investment over
 * a period of one year.  The initial amount of the investment
 * and the interest rate are input by the user.  The value of
 * the investment at the end of the year is output.  The
 * rate must be input as a decimal, not a percentage (for
 * example, 0.05 rather than 5).
 */
public class Interest2 {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
       double principal;  // The value of the investment.
       double rate;       // The annual interest rate.
       double interest;   // The interest earned during the year.
       
       System.out.print("Enter the initial investment: ");
       principal = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       
       System.out.print("Enter the annual interest rate (as a decimal): ");
       rate = TextIO.getlnDouble();
       
       interest = principal * rate;       // Compute this year's interest.
       principal = principal + interest;  // Add it to principal.
       
       System.out.printf("The amount of interest is $%1.2f%n", interest);
       System.out.printf("The value after one year is $%1.2f%n", principal);
       
   } // end of main()
      
} // end of class Interest2</pre>


<p>(You might be wondering why there is only one output routine, <span class="code">System.out.println</span>,
which can output data values of any type, while there is a
separate input routine for each data type. For the output function, the computer can
tell what type of value is being output by looking at the parameter.  However, the input
routines don't have parameters, so the different input routines can only be
distinguished by having different names.)</p>
