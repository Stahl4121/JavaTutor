<a name="basics.5.4">2.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Boolean Operators</a>
</h3>


<p>In English, complicated conditions can be formed using the words "and",
"or", and "not." For example, "If there is a test <b>and</b> you did <b>not</b>
study for it...". "And", "or", and "not" are <span class="newword">boolean operators</span>, and they exist
in Java as well as in English.</p>


<p>In Java, the boolean operator "and" is represented by <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span>.
The <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span> operator is used to combine two boolean values. The
result is also a boolean value. The result is <span class="code">true</span> if <b>both</b> of
the combined values are <span class="code">true</span>, and the result is <span class="code">false</span> if
<b>either</b> of the combined values is <span class="code">false</span>. For example, 
"<span class="code">(x&nbsp;==&nbsp;0) &amp;&amp; (y&nbsp;==&nbsp;0)</span>"
is <span class="code">true</span> if and only if both <span class="code">x</span> is
equal to 0 and <span class="code">y</span> is equal to&nbsp;0.</p>


<p>The boolean operator "or" is represented by <span class="code">||</span>. (That's supposed to
be two of the vertical line characters,&nbsp;<span class="code">|</span>.) The expression 
"<span class="code">A&nbsp;||&nbsp;B</span>" is <span class="code">true</span> if either <span class="code">A</span> is <span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">B</span> is
<span class="code">true</span>, or if both are true. "<span class="code">A&nbsp;||&nbsp;B</span>" is <span class="code">false</span> only if
both <span class="code">A</span> and <span class="code">B</span> are false.</p>


<p>The operators <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span> and <span class="code">||</span> are said to be
<span class="newword">short-circuited</span> versions of the boolean operators.
This means that the second operand of <span class="code">&amp;&amp;</span> or <span class="code">||</span> is not
necessarily evaluated. Consider the test</p>


<pre>(x != 0) &amp;&amp; (y/x &gt; 1)</pre>


<p>Suppose that the value of <span class="code">x</span> is in fact zero. In that case, the
division <span class="code">y/x</span> is undefined mathematically.
However, the computer will never perform the division, since when the computer
evaluates <span class="code">(x&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0)</span>, it finds that the result is <span class="code">false</span>, and so
it knows that (<span class="code">(x&nbsp;!=&nbsp;0)&nbsp;&amp;&amp;</span>&nbsp;<b>anything</b>) has to
be false. Therefore, it doesn't bother to evaluate the second operand.
The evaluation has been short-circuited and the division by zero
is avoided.  (This may seem like a technicality, and it is. But at
times, it will make your programming life a little easier.)</p>


<p>The boolean operator "not" is a unary operator. In Java, it is indicated by
<span class="code">!</span> and is written in front of its single operand. For example, if
<span class="code">test</span> is a boolean variable, then</p>


<pre>test = ! test;</pre>


<p>will reverse the value of test, changing it from <span class="code">true</span> to
<span class="code">false</span>, or from <span class="code">false</span> to <span class="code">true</span>.</p>

<a name="basics.5.5">2.5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditional Operator</a>
</h3>


<p>Any good programming language has some nifty little features that aren't
really necessary but that let you feel cool when you use them. Java has the
conditional operator. It's a ternary operator—that is, it has three operands—and
it comes in two pieces, ? and :, that have to be used together. It takes
the form</p>


<pre><span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> ? <span class="bnf">expression1</span> : <span class="bnf">expression2</span>
</pre>


<p>The computer tests the value of <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span>. If the value is <span class="code">true</span>, it
evaluates <span class="bnf">expression1</span>; otherwise, it evaluates
<span class="bnf">expression2</span>. For example:</p>


<pre>next = (N % 2 == 0) ? (N/2) : (3*N+1);</pre>


<p>will assign the value <span class="code">N/2</span> to <span class="code">next</span> if <span class="code">N</span> is even
(that is, if <span class="code">N&nbsp;%&nbsp;2&nbsp;==&nbsp;0</span> is <span class="code">true</span>), and it will assign the
value <span class="code">(3*N+1)</span> to <span class="code">next</span> if <span class="code">N</span> is odd.  (The parentheses
in this example are not required, but they do make the expression easier to read.)</p>
