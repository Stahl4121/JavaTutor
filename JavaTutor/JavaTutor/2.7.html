</h3>


<p>Classes can be containers for static variables and subroutines.  However classes also have
another purpose.  They are used to describe objects.  In
this role, the class is a <b>type</b>, in the same way that <span class="ptype">int</span>
and <span class="ptype">double</span> are types.  That is, the class name can be used to declare
variables. Such variables can only hold one type of value. The values in this case are
<span class="newword">objects</span>.  An object is a collection of variables and subroutines.
Every object has an associated class that tells what "type" of object it is.
The class of an object specifies what subroutines and variables that object contains.
All objects defined by the same class are similar in that they contain similar collections
of variables and subroutines.  For example, an object might represent a point in the plane,
and it might contain variables named <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> to represent the
coordinates of that point.  Every point object would have an <span class="code">x</span> and a <span class="code">y</span>,
but different points would have different values for these variables.  A class, named
<span class="classname">Point</span> for example, could exist to define the common structure of
all point objects, and all such objects would then be values of type <span class="classname">Point</span>.</p>


<p>As another example, let's look again at <span class="code">System.out.println</span>.  <span class="classname">System</span>
is a class, and <span class="code">out</span> is a static variable within that class.  However, the value of 
<span class="code">System.out</span> is an <b>object</b>, and <span class="code">System.out.println</span> is actually
the full name of a subroutine that is contained in the object <span class="code">System.out</span>.  You don't need to
understand it at this point, but  the object referred to by <span class="code">System.out</span>
is an object of the class <span class="classname">PrintStream</span>. <span class="classname">PrintStream</span> is another
class that is a standard part of Java. <b>Any</b> object of type
<span class="classname">PrintStream</span> is a destination to which information can be printed;
<b>any</b> object of type <span class="classname">PrintStream</span> has a <span class="code">println</span>
subroutine that can be used to send information to that destination. The object
<span class="code">System.out</span> is just one possible destination, and
<span class="code">System.out.println</span> is a subroutine that sends information to that particular
destination. Other objects of type <span class="classname">PrintStream</span> might send information
to other destinations such as files or across a network to other computers.
This is object-oriented programming: Many different things which have something
in common—they can all be used as destinations for output—can all be
used in the same way—through a <span class="code">println</span> subroutine. The
<span class="classname">PrintStream</span> class expresses the commonalities among all these
objects.</p>


<p>The dual role of classes can be confusing, and in practice most classes are designed to
perform primarily or exclusively in only one of the two possible roles.  Fortunately,
you will not need to worry too much about it until we start working with objects in a
more serious way, in Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.</p>


<p>By the way, since class names and variable names are used in similar ways, it might be
hard to tell which is which. Remember that all the built-in, predefined names in Java follow
the rule that class names begin with an upper case letter while variable names
begin with a lower case letter. While this is not a formal syntax rule, I strongly
recommend that you follow it in your own programming. Subroutine names should
also begin with lower case letters. There is no possibility of confusing a
variable with a subroutine, since a subroutine name in a program is always
followed by a left parenthesis.</p>
   

<p>As one final general note, you should be aware that subroutines in Java
are often referred to as <span class="newword">methods</span>.  Generally, the
term "method" means a subroutine that is contained in a class or in an object.
Since this is true of every subroutine in Java, every subroutine in Java is
a method. The same is not true for other programming languages, and
for the time being, I will prefer to use the more general term, "subroutine."
However, I should note that some people prefer to use the term "method" 
from the beginning.</p>
