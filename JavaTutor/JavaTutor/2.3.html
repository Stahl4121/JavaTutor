</h3>


<p>Java has other types in addition to the primitive types, but all the other
types represent objects rather than "primitive" data values. 
For the most part,
we are not concerned with objects for the time being. However, there is one
predefined object type that is very important: the type <span class="classname">String</span>. 
(<span class="classname">String</span> is a type, but not a primitive type; it is in fact the
name of a class.</p>



<p>A value of type <span class="classname">String</span> is a sequence of characters. You've already seen a string
literal: <span class="code">"Hello World!"</span>. The double quotes are part of the literal; they have
to be typed in the program. However, they are not part of the actual <span class="classname">String</span>
value, which consists of just the characters between the quotes.   A string can contain
any number of characters, even zero.  A string with no characters is called the
<span class="newword">empty string</span> and is represented by the literal <span class="code">""</span>, a pair
of double quote marks with nothing between them.  Remember the difference between single
quotes and double quotes!  Single quotes are used for <span class="ptype">char</span> literals and
double quotes for <span class="classname">String</span> literals!  There is a big difference between
the <span class="classname">String</span> <span class="code">"A"</span> and the <span class="ptype">char</span> <span class="code">'A'</span>.</p>


<p>Within a string literal, special characters can be represented using the backslash notation.
Within this context, the double quote is itself a special character. For
example, to represent the string <b>value</b>
</p>


<pre>I said, "Are you listening!"</pre>


<p>with a linefeed at the end, you would have to type the string <b>literal</b>:</p>


<pre>"I said, \"Are you listening!\"\n"</pre>


<p>You can also use <span class="code">\t</span>, <span class="code">\r</span>, <span class="code">\\</span>, 
and Unicode sequences such as <span class="code">\u00E9</span> to
represent other special characters in string literals.</p>
