<a name="basics.5.3">2.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Relational Operators</a>
</h3>


<p>Java has boolean variables and boolean-valued expressions that can be used
to express conditions that can be either <span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">false</span>. One
way to form a boolean-valued expression is to compare two values using a
<span class="newword">relational operator</span>. Relational operators are used
to test whether two values are equal, whether one value is greater than
another, and so forth. The relational operators in Java are: <span class="code">==</span>,
<span class="code">!=</span>, <span class="code">&lt;</span>, <span class="code">&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;=</span>, and <span class="code">&gt;=</span>.
The meanings of these operators are:</p>


<pre>A == B       Is A "equal to" B?
A != B       Is A "not equal to" B?
A &lt; B        Is A "less than" B?
A &gt; B        Is A "greater than" B?
A &lt;= B       Is A "less than or equal to" B?
A &gt;= B       Is A "greater than or equal to" B?</pre>


<p>These operators can be used to compare values of any of the numeric types.
They can also be used to compare values of type <span class="ptype">char</span>. For characters,
<span class="code">&lt;</span> and <span class="code">&gt;</span> are defined according the numeric Unicode
values of the characters. (This might not always be what you want. It is not
the same as alphabetical order because all the upper case letters come before
all the lower case letters.)</p>


<p>When using boolean expressions, you should remember that as far as the
computer is concerned, there is nothing special about boolean values. In the
next chapter, you will see how to use them in loop and branch statements. But
you can also assign boolean-valued expressions to boolean variables, just as
you can assign numeric values to numeric variables.  And functions can return
boolean values.</p>


<p>By the way, the operators <span class="code">==</span> and <span class="code">!=</span> can be used to compare boolean values too.
This is occasionally useful. For example, can you figure out what this
does:</p>


<pre>boolean sameSign;
sameSign = ((x &gt; 0) == (y &gt; 0));</pre>


<p>One thing that you <b>cannot</b> do with the relational operators
<span class="code">&lt;</span>, <span class="code">&gt;</span>, <span class="code">&lt;=</span>, and <span class="code">&gt;=</span> is to use them
to compare values of type <span class="classname">String</span>. You can legally use <span class="code">==</span> and
<span class="code">!=</span> to compare <span class="code">Strings</span>, but because of peculiarities in the
way objects behave, they might not give the results you want. (The <span class="code">==</span>
operator checks whether two objects are stored in the same memory location,
rather than whether they contain the same value. Occasionally, for some
objects, you do want to make such a checkâ€”but rarely for strings. I'll get
back to this in a later chapter.) Instead, you should compare strings using subroutines such as
<span class="code">equals()</span>  and <span class="code">compareTo()</span>, which
were described in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c2/s3.html#basics.3.3">Subsection&nbsp;2.3.3</a>.</p>


<p>Another place where <span class="code">==</span> and <span class="code">!=</span> don't work as you would expect
is with <span class="code">Double.NaN</span>, the constant that represents an undefined value of
type <span class="ptype">double</span>.  The values of <span class="code">x&nbsp;==&nbsp;Double.NaN</span>
and <span class="code">x&nbsp;!=&nbsp;Double.NaN</span> are both defined to be <span class="code">false</span> in
all cases, whether or not <span class="code">x</span> is <span class="code">Double.NaN</span>!  To test whether
a real value <span class="code">x</span> is the undefined value <span class="code">Double.NaN</span>,
use the <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function <span class="code">Double.isNaN(x)</span>.</p>
