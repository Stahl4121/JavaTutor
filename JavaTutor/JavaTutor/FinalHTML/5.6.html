</h3>


<p>A class can include other things besides subroutines. In particular, it can
also include variable declarations. Of course, you can declare variables
<b>inside</b> subroutines.  Those are called <span class="newword">local variables.</span> 
However, you can also have variables that are
not part of any subroutine. To distinguish such variables from local variables,
we call them <span class="newword">member variables</span>, since they are
members of a class.  Another term for them is <span class="newword">global variable</span>.</p>


<p>Just as with subroutines, member variables can be either static or
non-static. In this chapter, we'll stick to static variables. A static member
variable belongs to the class as a whole, and it exists as long as the class
exists. Memory is allocated for the variable when the class is first loaded by
the Java interpreter. Any assignment statement that assigns a value to the
variable changes the content of that memory, no matter where that assignment
statement is located in the program. Any time the variable is used in an
expression, the value is fetched from that same memory, no matter where the
expression is located in the program. This means that the value of a static
member variable can be set in one subroutine and used in another subroutine.
Static member variables are "shared" by all the static subroutines in the
class. A local variable in a subroutine, on the other hand, exists only while
that subroutine is being executed, and is completely inaccessible from outside
that one subroutine.</p>


<p>The declaration of a member variable looks just like the declaration of a
local variable except for two things: The member variable is declared outside
any subroutine (although it still has to be inside a class), and the
declaration can be marked with modifiers such as <span class="code">static</span>,
<span class="code">public</span>, and <span class="code">private</span>. Since we are only working with static
member variables for now, every declaration of a member variable in this
chapter will include the modifier <span class="code">static</span>.  They might also
be marked as <span class="code">public</span> or <span class="code">private</span>.  For example:</p>


<pre>static String usersName;
public static int numberOfPlayers;
private static double velocity, time;</pre>


<p>A static member variable that is not declared to be <span class="code">private</span> can be
accessed from outside the class where it is defined, as well as inside. When it
is used in some other class, it must be referred to with a compound identifier
of the form <span class="bnf">class-name</span>.<span class="bnf">variable-name</span>. For example, the <span class="classname">System</span> class
contains the public static member variable named <span class="code">out</span>, and you use this
variable in your own classes by referring to <span class="code">System.out</span>.   Similarly,
<span class="code">Math.PI</span> is a public static member variable in the <span class="classname">Math</span> class.  If
<span class="code">numberOfPlayers</span> is a public static member variable in a class named
<span class="code">Poker</span>, then code in the <span class="code">Poker</span> class would refer to it
simply as <span class="code">numberOfPlayers</span>, while code in another class would refer to
it as <span class="code">Poker.numberOfPlayers</span>.</p>


<p>As an example, let's add a couple of static member variables to the
<span class="code">GuessingGame</span> class that we wrote earlier in this section.
We add a variable named <span class="code">gamesPlayed</span> to keep track of how
many games the user has played and another variable named <span class="code">gamesWon</span>
to keep track of the number of games that the user has won.  The variables
are declared as static member variables:</p>


<pre>static int gamesPlayed;
static int gamesWon;</pre>


<p>In the <span class="code">playGame()</span> routine, we always add 1 to <span class="code">gamesPlayed</span>,
and we add 1 to  <span class="code">gamesWon</span> if the user wins the game. 
At the end of the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, we print out the values of both variables.
It would be impossible to 
do the same thing with local variables, since both subroutines need to access the variables,
and local variables exist in only one subroutine.  Furthermore, global variables keep
their values between one subroutine call and the next. Local variables do not; a local
variable gets a new value each time that the subroutine that contains it is called.</p>


<p>When you declare a local variable in a subroutine, you have to assign a
value to that variable before you can do anything with it. Member variables, on
the other hand are automatically initialized with a default value.  The default
values are the same as those that are used when initializing the elements of an array:
For numeric variables, the default value is zero; for <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variables, the
default is <span class="code">false</span>; for <span class="ptype">char</span> variables, it's the
character that has Unicode code number zero; and for objects, such as
<span class="classname">Strings</span>, the default initial value is the special value
<span class="code">null</span>.</p>


<p>Since they are of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, the static member variables <span class="code">gamesPlayed</span>
and <span class="code">gamesWon</span> automatically get zero as their initial value. This
happens to be the correct initial value for a variable that is being used as a
counter. You can, of course, assign a value to a variable at the
beginning of the <span class="code">main()</span> routine if you are not satisfied with the
default initial value, or if you want to make the initial value more explicit.</p>


<p>Here's the revised version of <span class="code">GuessingGame.java</span>. 
The changes from the above version are shown in red:</p>


<pre>import textio.TextIO;

public class GuessingGame2 {
 
    <span class="newcode">static int gamesPlayed;   // The number of games played.
    static int gamesWon;      // The number of games won.</span>
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       <span class="newcode">gamesPlayed = 0;
       gamesWon = 0;  // This is actually redundant, since 0 is 
                      //                 the default initial value.</span>
       System.out.println("Let's play a game.  I'll pick a number between");
       System.out.println("1 and 100, and you try to guess it.");
       boolean playAgain;
       do {
          playGame();  // call subroutine to play one game
          System.out.print("Would you like to play again? ");
          playAgain = TextIO.getlnBoolean();
       } while (playAgain);
       <span class="newcode">System.out.println();
       System.out.println("You played " + gamesPlayed + " games,");
       System.out.println("and you won " + gamesWon + " of those games.");</span>
       System.out.println("Thanks for playing.  Goodbye.");
    } // end of main()            
    
    static void playGame() {
        int computersNumber; // A random number picked by the computer.
        int usersGuess;      // A number entered by user as a guess.
        int guessCount;      // Number of guesses the user has made.
        <span class="newcode">gamesPlayed++;  // Count this game.</span>
        computersNumber = (int)(100 * Math.random()) + 1;
                 // The value assigned to computersNumber is a randomly
                 //    chosen integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
        guessCount = 0;
        System.out.println();
        System.out.print("What is your first guess? ");
        while (true) {
           usersGuess = TextIO.getInt();  // Get the user's guess.
           guessCount++;
           if (usersGuess == computersNumber) {
              System.out.println("You got it in " + guessCount
                      + " guesses!  My number was " + computersNumber);
              <span class="newcode">gamesWon++;  // Count this win.</span>
              break;       // The game is over; the user has won.
           }
           if (guessCount == 6) {
              System.out.println("You didn't get the number in 6 guesses.");
              System.out.println("You lose.  My number was " + computersNumber);
              break;  // The game is over; the user has lost.
           }
           // If we get to this point, the game continues.
           // Tell the user if the guess was too high or too low.
           if (usersGuess &lt; computersNumber)
              System.out.print("That's too low.  Try again: ");
           else if (usersGuess &gt; computersNumber)
              System.out.print("That's too high.  Try again: ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    } // end of playGame()
                
} // end of class GuessingGame2</pre>
