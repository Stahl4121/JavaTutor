<span class="start"><big>W</big>e turn in this section</span> to another type of loop,
the <span class="code">for</span> statement. Any <span class="code">for</span> loop is equivalent to some
<span class="code">while</span> loop, so the language doesn't get any additional power by having
<span class="code">for</span> statements. But for a certain type of problem, a <span class="code">for</span> loop
can be easier to construct and easier to read than the corresponding
<span class="code">while</span> loop. It's quite possible that in real programs, <span class="code">for</span>
loops actually outnumber <span class="code">while</span> loops (and I know of at least one person
who <b>only</b> uses <span class="code">for</span> loops).</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="control.4.1">3.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;For Loops</a>
</h3>


<p>The <span class="code">for</span> statement makes a common type of while loop easier to
write. Many while loops have the general form:</p>


<pre><span class="bnf">initialization</span>
while ( <span class="bnf">continuation-condition</span> ) {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
    <span class="bnf">update</span>
}</pre>


<p>For example, consider this example, copied from an example in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c3/s2.html">Section&nbsp;3.2</a>:</p>


<pre>years = 0;  // <b>initialize</b> the variable years
while ( years &lt; 5 ) {   // <b>condition</b> for continuing loop

    interest = principal * rate;    //
    principal += interest;          // do three <b>statements</b>
    System.out.println(principal);  //
    
    years++;   // <b>update</b> the value of the variable, years
}</pre>


<p>This loop can be written as the following equivalent <span class="code">for</span>
statement:</p>


<pre>for ( years = 0;  years &lt; 5;  years++ ) {
   interest = principal * rate;
   principal += interest;
   System.out.println(principal);
}</pre>


<p>The initialization, continuation condition, and updating have all been
combined in the first line of the <span class="code">for</span> loop. This keeps everything
involved in the "control" of the loop in one place, which helps make the loop
easier to read and understand. The <span class="code">for</span> loop is executed in exactly the
same way as the original code: The initialization part is executed once, before
the loop begins. The continuation condition is executed before each execution
of the loop (including the first execution), and the loop ends when this condition is <span class="code">false</span>. The
update part is executed at the end of each execution of the loop, just before
jumping back to check the condition.</p>


<p>The formal syntax of the <span class="code">for</span> statement is as follows:</p>


<pre>for ( <span class="bnf">initialization</span>; <span class="bnf">continuation-condition</span>; <span class="bnf">update</span> )
     <span class="bnf">statement</span>
</pre>


<p>or, using a block statement:</p>


<pre>for ( <span class="bnf">initialization</span>; <span class="bnf">continuation-condition</span>; <span class="bnf">update</span> ) {
     <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</pre>


<p>The <span class="bnf">continuation-condition</span> must be a
boolean-valued expression. The <span class="bnf">initialization</span>
is usually a declaration or an assignment statement, but it
can be any expression that would be allowed as a statement in a program.
The <span class="bnf">update</span> can be any simple statement, but is usually
an increment, a decrement, or an assignment statement. Any
of the three parts can be empty. If the continuation condition is empty, it is
treated as if it were "<span class="code">true</span>," so the loop will be repeated forever or
until it ends for some other reason, such as a <span class="code">break</span> statement. (Some
people like to begin an infinite loop with "<span class="code">for&nbsp;(;;)</span>" instead of
"<span class="code">while&nbsp;(true)</span>".)  Here's a flow control diagram for a <span class="code">for</span>
statement:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="./sec3.4.1_files/for-loop-flow-control.png" width="186" height="401" alt="control diagram for a for loop" class="bordered"></p>


<p>Usually, the initialization part of a <span class="code">for</span> statement assigns a value
to some variable, and the update changes the value of that variable with an
assignment statement or with an increment or decrement operation. The value of
the variable is tested in the continuation condition, and the loop ends when
this condition evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>. A variable used in this way is
called a <span class="newword">loop control variable</span>. In the
example given above, the loop control variable was <span class="code">years</span>.</p>


<p>Certainly, the most common type of <span class="code">for</span> loop is the <span class="newword">counting loop</span>, 
where a loop control variable takes on all
integer values between some minimum and some maximum value. A counting loop has
the form</p>


<pre>for ( <span class="bnf">variable</span> = <span class="bnf">min</span>;  <span class="bnf">variable</span> &lt;= <span class="bnf">max</span>; <span class="bnf">variable</span>++ ) {
     <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</pre>


<p>where <span class="bnf">min</span> and <span class="bnf">max</span> are integer-valued expressions (usually constants). The
<span class="bnf">variable</span> takes on the values <span class="bnf">min</span>, <span class="bnf">min</span>+1, 
<span class="bnf">min</span>+2,&nbsp;..., <span class="bnf">max</span>. The value
of the loop control variable is often used in the body of the loop. The
<span class="code">for</span> loop at the beginning of this section is a counting loop in which
the loop control variable, <span class="code">years</span>, takes on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Here is an even simpler example, in which the numbers 1, 2,&nbsp;..., 10 are
displayed on standard output:</p>


<pre>for ( N = 1 ;  N &lt;= 10 ;  N++ )
   System.out.println( N );</pre>


<p>For various reasons, Java programmers like to start counting at 0 instead of
1, and they tend to use a "<span class="code">&lt;</span>" in the condition, rather than a
"<span class="code">&lt;=</span>". The following variation of the above loop prints out the ten
numbers 0, 1, 2,&nbsp;..., 9:</p>


<pre>for ( N = 0 ;  N &lt; 10 ;  N++ )
   System.out.println( N );</pre>


<p>Using <span class="code">&lt;</span> instead of <span class="code">&lt;=</span> in the test, or vice versa, is
a common source of off-by-one errors in programs. You should always stop and
think, Do I want the final value to be processed or not?</p>


<p>It's easy to count down from 10 to 1 instead of counting up. Just start with
10, decrement the loop control variable instead of incrementing it, and
continue as long as the variable is greater than or equal to one.</p>


<pre>for ( N = 10 ;  N &gt;= 1 ;  N-- )
   System.out.println( N );</pre>


<p>Now, in fact, the official syntax of a <span class="code">for</span> statement actually
allows both the initialization part and the update part to consist of several
expressions, separated by commas. So we can even count up from 1 to 10 and
count down from 10 to 1 at the same time!</p>


<pre>for ( i=1, j=10;  i &lt;= 10;  i++, j-- ) {
   System.out.printf("%5d", i); // Output i in a 5-character wide column.
   System.out.printf("%5d", j); // Output j in a 5-character column.
   System.out.println();       //     and end the line.
}</pre>


<p>As a final introductory example, let's say that we want to use a <span class="code">for</span> loop that
prints out just the even numbers between 2 and 20, that is: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
14, 16, 18, 20. There are several ways to do this. Just to show how even a very
simple problem can be solved in many ways, here are four different solutions
(three of which would get full credit):</p>


<pre> (1)   // There are 10 numbers to print.           
       // Use a for loop to count 1, 2,            
       // ..., 10.  The numbers we want            
       // to print are 2*1, 2*2, ... 2*10.         
   
       for (N = 1; N &lt;= 10; N++) {              
          System.out.println( 2*N );                
       }
       
       
 (2)   // Use a for loop that counts
       // 2, 4, ..., 20 directly by
       // adding 2 to N each time through
       // the loop.
       
       for (N = 2; N &lt;= 20; N = N + 2) {
          System.out.println( N );
       }
       
       
 (3)   // Count off all the numbers    
       // 2, 3, 4, ..., 19, 20, but                
       // only print out the numbers               
       // that are even.                           
    
       for (N = 2; N &lt;= 20; N++) {               
          if ( N % 2 == 0 ) // is N even?           
             System.out.println( N );               
       } 
   
   
 (4)   // Irritate the professor with
       // a solution that follows the
       // letter of this silly assignment
       // while making fun of it.
       
       for (N = 1; N &lt;= 1; N++) {
          System.out.println("2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20");
       }
</pre>

   

<p>Perhaps it is worth stressing one more time that a <span class="code">for</span> statement,
like any statement except for a variable declaration, never occurs on its own in a real program. A statement must
be inside the <span class="code">main</span> routine of a program or inside some other
subroutine. And that subroutine must be defined inside a class. I should also
remind you that every variable must be declared before it can be used, and that
includes the loop control variable in a <span class="code">for</span> statement. In all the
examples that you have seen so far in this section, the loop control variables
should be declared to be of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. It is not required that a loop
control variable be an integer. Here, for example, is a <span class="code">for</span> loop in
which the variable, <span class="code">ch</span>, is of type <span class="ptype">char</span>, using
the fact that the <span class="code">++</span> operator can be applied to characters as
well as to numbers:</p>


<pre>// Print out the alphabet on one line of output.
char ch;  // The loop control variable; 
          //       one of the letters to be printed.
for ( ch = 'A';  ch &lt;= 'Z';  ch++ )
    System.out.print(ch);
System.out.println();</pre>
