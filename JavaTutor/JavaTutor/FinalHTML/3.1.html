</h3>


<p>The <span class="newword">block</span> is the simplest type of structured
statement. Its purpose is simply to group a sequence of statements into a
single statement. The format of a block is:</p>


<pre>{
     <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</pre>


<p>That is, it consists of a sequence of statements enclosed between a pair of
braces, "{" and "}". In fact, it is possible for a block to contain no
statements at all; such a block is called an <span class="newword">empty block</span>, 
and can actually be useful at times. An empty block consists of
nothing but an empty pair of braces. Block statements usually occur inside
other statements, where their purpose is to group together several statements
into a unit. However, a block can be legally used wherever a statement can
occur. There is one place where a block is required: As you might have already
noticed in the case of the <span class="code">main</span> subroutine of a program, the
definition of a subroutine is a block, since it is a sequence of statements
enclosed inside a pair of braces.</p>


<p>I should probably note again at this point that Java is what is called a
free-format language. There are no syntax rules about how the language has to
be arranged on a page. So, for example, you could write an entire block on one
line if you want. But as a matter of good programming style, you should lay out
your program on the page in a way that will make its structure as clear as
possible. In general, this means putting one statement per line and using
indentation to indicate statements that are contained inside control
structures. This is the format that I will use in my examples.</p>


<p>Here are two examples of blocks:</p>


<pre>{
   System.out.print("The answer is ");
   System.out.println(ans);
}
  
 
{  // This block exchanges the values of x and y
   int temp;      // A temporary variable for use in this block.
   temp = x;      // Save a copy of the value of x in temp.
   x = y;         // Copy the value of y into x.
   y = temp;      // Copy the value of temp into y.
}</pre>


<p>In the second example, a variable, <span class="code">temp</span>, is declared inside the
block. This is perfectly legal, and it is good style to declare a variable
inside a block if that variable is used nowhere else but inside the block. A
variable declared inside a block is completely inaccessible and invisible from
outside that block. When the computer executes the variable declaration
statement, it allocates memory to hold the value of the variable (at least conceptually). When the
block ends, that memory is discarded (that is, made available for reuse). The
variable is said to be <span class="newword">local</span> to the block. There
is a general concept called the "scope" of an identifier. The <span class="newword">scope</span> 
of an identifier is the part of the program in which
that identifier is valid. The scope of a variable defined inside a block is
limited to that block, and more specifically to the part of the block that
comes after the declaration of the variable.</p
