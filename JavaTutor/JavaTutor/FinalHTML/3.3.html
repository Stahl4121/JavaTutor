<a name="control.1.2">3.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The Basic While Loop</a>
</h3>


<p>The block statement by itself really doesn't affect the flow of control in a
program. The five remaining control structures do. They can be divided into two
classes: loop statements and branching statements. You really just need one
control structure from each category in order to have a completely
general-purpose programming language. More than that is just convenience. In
this section, I'll introduce the <span class="code">while</span> loop and the <span class="code">if</span>
statement. I'll give the full details of these statements and of the other
three control structures in later sections.</p>


<p>A <span class="newword">while loop</span> is used to repeat a given
statement over and over. Of course, it's not likely that you would want to keep
repeating it forever. That would be an <span class="newword">infinite loop</span>, which is 
generally a bad thing. (There is an old story about
computer pioneer Grace Murray Hopper, who read instructions on a bottle of
shampoo telling her to "lather, rinse, repeat." As the story goes, she claims
that she tried to follow the directions, but she ran out of shampoo. (In case
you don't get it, she was making a joke about the way that computers mindlessly follow
instructions.))</p>


<p>To be more specific, a <span class="code">while</span> loop will repeat a statement over and
over, but only so long as a specified condition remains true. A <span class="code">while</span>
loop has the form:</p>


<pre>while (<span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span>)
     <span class="bnf">statement</span>
</pre>


<p>Since the statement can be, and usually is, a block, most <span class="code">while</span>
loops have the form:</p>


<pre>while (<span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span>) {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</pre>


<p>Some programmers think that the braces should always be included as a matter
of style, even when there is only one statement between them, but I don't always
follow that advice myself.</p>


<p>The semantics of the <span class="code">while</span> statement go like this: When the computer comes to a
<span class="code">while</span> statement, it evaluates the <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span>, 
which yields either <span class="code">true</span> or
<span class="code">false</span> as its value. If the value is <span class="code">false</span>, the computer skips
over the rest of the <span class="code">while</span> loop and proceeds to the next command in
the program. If the value of the expression is <span class="code">true</span>, the computer
executes the <span class="bnf">statement</span> or block of <span class="bnf">statements</span> inside the loop. Then it returns to the
beginning of the <span class="code">while</span> loop and repeats the process. That is, it
re-evaluates the <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span>, ends the
loop if the value is <span class="code">false</span>, and continues it if the value is
<span class="code">true</span>. This will continue over and over until the value of the
expression is <span class="code">false</span> when the computer evaluates it; if that never happens, then there will be an
infinite loop.</p>


<p>Here is an example of a <span class="code">while</span> loop that simply prints out the
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:</p>


<pre>int number;   // The number to be printed.
number = 1;   // Start with 1.
while ( number &lt; 6 ) {  // Keep going as long as number is &lt; 6.
    System.out.println(number);
    number = number + 1;  // Go on to the next number.
}
System.out.println("Done!");</pre>


<p>The variable <span class="code">number</span> is initialized with the value&nbsp;1. So 
when the computer evaluates the
expression "<span class="code">number&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;6</span>" for the first time, 
it is asking whether 1 is less than 6, which is
<span class="code">true</span>. The computer therefore proceeds to execute the two statements
inside the loop. The first statement prints out "1". The second statement adds
1 to <span class="code">number</span> and stores the result back into the variable
<span class="code">number</span>; the value of <span class="code">number</span> has been changed to 2. The
computer has reached the end of the loop, so it returns to the beginning and
asks again whether <span class="code">number</span> is less than 6. Once again this is true, so
the computer executes the loop again, this time printing out 2 as the value of
<span class="code">number</span> and then changing the value of <span class="code">number</span> to 3. It
continues in this way until eventually <span class="code">number</span> becomes equal to 6. At
that point, the expression "<span class="code">number&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;6</span>" evaluates to <span class="code">false</span>. So, the
computer jumps past the end of the loop to the next statement and prints out
the message "Done!". Note that when the loop ends, the value of <span class="code">number</span>
is 6, but the last value that was printed was 5.</p>


<p>By the way, you should remember that you'll never see a <span class="code">while</span> loop
standing by itself in a real program. It will always be inside a subroutine
which is itself defined inside some class. As an example of a <span class="code">while</span>
loop used inside a complete program, here is a little program that computes the
interest on an investment over several years. This is an improvement over
examples from the previous chapter that just reported the results for one
year:</p>


<pre>import textio.TextIO;

/**
 *  This class implements a simple program that will compute the amount of 
 *  interest that is earned on an investment over a period of 5 years.  The 
 *  initial amount of the investment and the interest rate are input by the 
 *  user.  The value of the investment at the end of each year is output.
 */ 
public class Interest3 {
     
 
   public static void main(String[] args) {
  
      double principal;  // The value of the investment.
      double rate;       // The annual interest rate.
      
      /* Get the initial investment and interest rate from the user. */
      
      System.out.print("Enter the initial investment: ");
      principal = TextIO.getlnDouble();
      
      System.out.println();
      System.out.println("Enter the annual interest rate.");
      System.out.print("Enter a decimal, not a percentage: ");
      rate = TextIO.getlnDouble();
      System.out.println();
      
      /* Simulate the investment for 5 years. */
      
      int years;  // Counts the number of years that have passed.
      
      years = 0;
      while (years &lt; 5) {
         double interest;  // Interest for this year.
         interest = principal * rate;
         principal = principal + interest;     // Add it to principal.
         years = years + 1;    // Count the current year.
         System.out.print("The value of the investment after ");
         System.out.print(years);
         System.out.print(" years is $");
         System.out.printf("%1.2f", principal);
         System.out.println();
      } // end of while loop
                       
   } // end of main()
        
} // end of class Interest3

<a name="control.3.1">3.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The while Statement</a>
</h3>


<p>The <span class="code">while</span> statement was already introduced in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c3/s1.html">Section&nbsp;3.1</a>. 
A <span class="code">while</span> loop has the form</p>


<pre>while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> )
   <span class="bnf">statement</span>
</pre>


<p>The <span class="bnf">statement</span> can, of course, be a block
statement consisting of several statements grouped together between a pair of
braces. This statement is called the <span class="newword">body of the loop</span>. 
The body of the loop is repeated as long as the <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> is true. This boolean expression is
called the <span class="newword">continuation condition</span>, or more simply
the <span class="newword">test</span>, of the loop. There are a few points that
might need some clarification. What happens if the condition is false in the
first place, before the body of the loop is executed even once? In that case,
the body of the loop is never executed at all. The body of a while loop can be
executed any number of times, including zero. What happens if the condition is
true, but it becomes false somewhere in the <b>middle</b> of the loop
body? Does the loop end as soon as this happens? It doesn't, because the
computer continues executing the body of the loop until it gets to the end.
Only then does it jump back to the beginning of the loop and test the
condition, and only then can the loop end.</p>


<p>Let's look at a typical problem that can be solved using a <span class="code">while</span>
loop: finding the average of a set of positive integers entered by the user.
The average is the sum of the integers, divided by the number of integers. The
program will ask the user to enter one integer at a time. It will keep count of
the number of integers entered, and it will keep a running total of all the
numbers it has read so far. Here is a pseudocode algorithm for the program:</p>


<pre>Let sum = 0     // The sum of the integers entered by the user.
Let count = 0   // The number of integers entered by the user.
while there are more integers to process:
    Read an integer
    Add it to the sum
    Count it
Divide sum by count to get the average
Print out the average</pre>


<p>But how can we test whether there are more integers to process? A typical
solution is to tell the user to type in zero after all the data have been
entered. This will work because we are assuming that all the data are positive
numbers, so zero is not a legal data value. The zero is not itself part of the
data to be averaged. It's just there to mark the end of the real data. A data
value used in this way is sometimes called a <span class="newword">sentinel value</span>. 
So now the test in the while loop becomes "while the input
integer is not zero". But there is another problem! The first time the test is
evaluated, before the body of the loop has ever been executed, no integer has
yet been read. There is no "input integer" yet, so testing whether the input
integer is zero doesn't make sense. So, we have to do something
<b>before</b> the while loop to make sure that the test makes sense.
Setting things up so that the test in a <span class="code">while</span> loop makes sense the
first time it is executed is called <span class="newword">priming the loop</span>. 
In this case, we can simply read the first integer before the
beginning of the loop. Here is a revised algorithm:</p>


<pre>Let sum = 0
Let count = 0
Read an integer
while the integer is not zero:
    Add the integer to the sum
    Count it
    Read an integer
Divide sum by count to get the average
Print out the average</pre>


<p>Notice that I've rearranged the body of the loop. Since an integer is read
before the loop, the loop has to begin by processing that integer. At the end
of the loop, the computer reads a new integer. The computer then jumps back to
the beginning of the loop and tests the integer that it has just read. Note
that when the computer finally reads the sentinel value, the loop ends before
the sentinel value is processed. It is not added to the sum, and it is not
counted. This is the way it's supposed to work. The sentinel is not part of the
data. The original algorithm, even if it could have been made to work without
priming, was incorrect since it would have summed and counted all the integers,
including the sentinel. (Since the sentinel is zero, the sum would still be
correct, but the count would be off by one. Such so-called <span class="newword">off-by-one errors</span> 
are very common. Counting turns out to be
harder than it looks!)</p>


<p>We can easily turn the algorithm into a complete program. Note that the
program cannot use the statement "<span class="code">average&nbsp;=&nbsp;sum/count</span>;" to compute the
average. Since <span class="code">sum</span> and <span class="code">count</span> are both variables of type
<span class="ptype">int</span>, the value of <span class="code">sum/count</span> is an integer. The average should
be a real number. We've seen this problem before: we have to convert one of the
<span class="ptype">int</span> values to a <span class="ptype">double</span> to force the computer to compute the
quotient as a real number. This can be done by type-casting one of the
variables to type <span class="ptype">double</span>. The type cast "(double)sum" converts the
value of <span class="code">sum</span> to a real number, so in the program the average is
computed as "<span class="code">average&nbsp;= ((double)sum)&nbsp;/&nbsp;count</span>;". Another solution in
this case would have been to declare <span class="code">sum</span> to be a variable of type
<span class="ptype">double</span> in the first place.</p>


<p>One other issue is addressed by the program: If the user enters zero as the
first input value, there are no data to process. We can test for this case by
checking whether <span class="code">count</span> is still equal to zero after the <span class="code">while</span>
loop. This might seem like a minor point, but a careful programmer should cover
all the bases.</p>



<p>Here is the full source code for the program (with comments added, of course!):</p>


<pre>import textio.TextIO;

/**
 * This program reads a sequence of positive integers input
 * by the user, and it will print out the average of those
 * integers.  The user is prompted to enter one integer at a
 * time.  The user must enter a 0 to mark the end of the
 * data.  (The zero is not counted as part of the data to
 * be averaged.)  The program does not check whether the
 * user's input is positive, so it will actually add up
 * both positive and negative input values.
 */
public class ComputeAverage {
        
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      
      int inputNumber;   // One of the integers input by the user.
      int sum;           // The sum of the positive integers.
      int count;         // The number of positive integers.
      double average;    // The average of the positive integers.
      
      /* Initialize the summation and counting variables. */
      
      sum = 0;
      count = 0;
      
      /* Read and process the user's input. */
      
      System.out.print("Enter your first positive integer: ");
      inputNumber = TextIO.getlnInt();
      
      while (inputNumber != 0) {
         sum += inputNumber;   // Add inputNumber to running sum.
         count++;              // Count the input by adding 1 to count.
         System.out.print("Enter your next positive integer, or 0 to end: ");
         inputNumber = TextIO.getlnInt();
      }
      
      /* Display the result. */
      
      if (count == 0) {
         System.out.println("You didn't enter any data!");
      }
      else {
         average = ((double)sum) / count;
         System.out.println();
         System.out.println("You entered " + count + " positive integers.");
         System.out.printf("Their average is %1.3f.\n", average);
      }
 
   } // end main()
   
} // end class ComputeAverage</pre>

computer does step-by-step as it executes the <span class="code">while</span> loop.</p>
