<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>A</big> subroutine that returns a value</span> is called a
<span class="newword">function</span>. A given function can only return a value
of a specified type, called the <span class="newword">return type</span> of the
function. A function call generally occurs in a position where the computer is
expecting to find a value, such as the right side of an assignment statement,
as an actual parameter in a subroutine call, or in the middle of some larger
expression. A boolean-valued function can even be used as the test condition in
an <span class="code">if</span>, <span class="code">while</span>, <span class="code">for</span> or <span class="code">do..while</span> statement.</p>


<p>(It is also legal to use a function call as a stand-alone statement, just as
if it were a regular subroutine. In this case, the computer ignores the value
computed by the subroutine. Sometimes this makes sense. For example, the
function <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span>, with a return type of <span class="classname">String</span>, reads
and returns a line of input typed in by the user. Usually, the line that is
returned is assigned to a variable to be used later in the program, as in the
statement "<span class="code">name&nbsp;=&nbsp;TextIO.getln();</span>". However, this function is also
useful as a subroutine call statement "<span class="code">TextIO.getln();</span>", which still
reads all input up to and including the next carriage return.  Since the return value
is not assigned to a variable or used in an expression, it is simply discarded.
So, the effect of the subroutine call is to read <b>and discard</b> some input.
Sometimes, discarding unwanted input is exactly what you need to do.)</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.4.1">4.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The return statement</a>
</h3>
   

<p>You've already seen how functions such as <span class="code">Math.sqrt()</span> and
<span class="code">TextIO.getInt()</span> can be used. What you haven't seen is how to write
functions of your own. A function takes the same form as a regular subroutine,
except that you have to specify the value that is to be returned by the
subroutine. This is done with a <span class="newword">return statement</span>,
which has the following syntax:</p>


<pre>return  <span class="bnf">expression</span> ;</pre>


<p>Such a <span class="code">return</span> statement can only occur inside the definition of a
function, and the type of the <span class="bnf">expression</span> must
match the return type that was specified for the function. (More exactly, it
must be an expression that could legally be assigned to a variable whose type is specified by
the return type of the function.) When the computer executes this <span class="code">return</span> statement, it
evaluates the expression, terminates execution of the function, and uses the
value of the expression as the returned value of the function.</p>


<p>For example, consider the function definition</p>


<pre>static double pythagoras(double x, double y) {
      // Computes the length of the hypotenuse of a right
      // triangle, where the sides of the triangle are x and y.
    return  Math.sqrt( x*x + y*y );
}</pre>


<p>Suppose the computer executes the statement "<span class="code">totalLength = 17 +
pythagoras(12,5);</span>". When it gets to the term <span class="code">pythagoras(12,5)</span>, it
assigns the actual parameters <span class="code">12</span> and <span class="code">5</span> to the formal
parameters <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> in the function. In the body of the
function, it evaluates <span class="code">Math.sqrt(12.0*12.0&nbsp;+&nbsp;5.0*5.0)</span>, which works out
to <span class="code">13.0</span>. This value is "returned" by the function, so the <span class="code">13.0</span> essentially
replaces the function call in the assignment statement, which then has the same effect
as the statement "<span class="code">totalLength&nbsp;=&nbsp;17+<span class="newcode">13.0</span></span>". 
The return value is added to <span class="code">17</span>, and the result, 30.0, is stored in the variable,
<span class="code">totalLength</span>.</p>
   

<p>Note that a <span class="code">return</span> statement does not have to be the last
statement in the function definition.  At any point in the function where you
know the value that you want to return, you can return it.  Returning a value
will end the function immediately, skipping any subsequent statements in the
function.  However, it must be the case that the function definitely does
return some value, no matter what path the execution of the function takes
through the code.</p>


<p>You can use a <span class="code">return</span> statement inside an ordinary subroutine,  one
with declared return type "<span class="code">void</span>".  Since a void subroutine
does not return a value, the <span class="code">return</span> statement does not include 
an expression; it simply takes the form "<span class="code">return;</span>".  The effect
of this statement is to
terminate execution of the subroutine and return control back to the point in
the program from which the subroutine was called. This can be convenient if you
want to terminate execution somewhere in the middle of the subroutine, but
<span class="code">return</span> statements are optional in non-function subroutines. In a
function, on the other hand, a return statement, with expression, is always
required.</p>


<p>Note that a <span class="code">return</span> inside a loop will end the
loop as well as the subroutine that contains it.  Similarly, a <span class="code">return</span>
in a <span class="code">switch</span> statement breaks out of the <span class="code">switch</span> statement as well as
the subroutine.  So, you will sometimes use <span class="code">return</span> in contexts where
you are used to seeing a <span class="code">break</span>.</p>
