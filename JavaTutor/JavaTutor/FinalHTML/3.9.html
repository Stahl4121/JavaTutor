<span class="start"><big>I</big>n addition to the control</span> structures that
determine the normal flow of control in a program, Java has a way to deal
with "exceptional" cases that throw the flow of control off its normal
track.  When an error occurs during the execution of a program, the default
behavior is to terminate the program and to print an error message.  However,
Java makes it possible to "catch" such errors and program a response different
from simply letting the program crash.  This is done with the
<span class="newword">try..catch</span> statement.  In this section, we will
take a preliminary and incomplete look the <span class="code">try..catch</span> statement,
leaving out a lot of the rather complex syntax of this statement.
Error handling is a complex topic, which we will return to in
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c8/s3.html">Section&nbsp;8.3</a>, and we will cover the full syntax
of <span class="code">try..catch</span> at that time.</p>

</h3>


<p>The term <span class="newword">exception</span> is used to refer to the type of
event that one might want to handle with a <span class="code">try..catch</span>.  An
exception is an exception to the normal flow of control in the program.
The term is used in preference to "error" because in some cases,
an exception might not be considered to be an error at all.  You can
sometimes think of an exception as just another way to organize
a program.</p>
   

<p>Exceptions in Java are represented as objects of type <span class="classname">Exception</span>.
Actual exceptions are usually defined by subclasses of <span class="classname">Exception</span>.
Different subclasses represent different types of exceptions.  We will look at only
two types of exception in this section:  <span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span>
and <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span>.</p>
   

<p>A <span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span> can occur when an attempt
is made to convert a string into a number.  Such conversions are done by
the functions <span class="code">Integer.parseInt</span> and <span class="code">Double.parseDouble</span>.
(See <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c2/s5.html#basics.5.7">Subsection&nbsp;2.5.7</a>.)  Consider the function call <span class="code">Integer.parseInt(str)</span>
where <span class="code">str</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">String</span>.
If the value of <span class="code">str</span> is the string <span class="code">"42"</span>, then the
function call will correctly convert the string into the <span class="ptype">int</span>&nbsp;42.
However, if the value of <span class="code">str</span> is, say, <span class="code">"fred"</span>, the function call 
will fail because <span class="code">"fred"</span> is not a legal string representation of
an <span class="ptype">int</span> value.  In this case, an exception of type
<span class="classname">NumberFormatException</span> occurs.  If nothing is done
to handle the exception, the program will crash.</p>


<p>An <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span> can occur when an illegal
value is passed as a parameter to a subroutine.  For example, if a subroutine
requires that a parameter be greater than or equal to zero, an <span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span>
might occur when a negative value is passed to the subroutine.
How to respond to the illegal value is up to the person who wrote the subroutine, 
so we can't simply say that every illegal parameter value will result in an
<span class="classname">IllegalArgumentException</span>.  However, it is a common response.</p>
