</h3>


<p>When you define a subroutine, all you are doing is telling the computer that
the subroutine exists and what it does. The subroutine doesn't actually get
executed until it is called. (This is true even for the <span class="code">main()</span> routine
in a classâ€”even though <b>you</b> don't call it, it is called by
the system when the system runs your program.) For example, the
<span class="code">playGame()</span> method given as an example above could be called using the following
subroutine call statement:</p>


<pre>playGame();</pre>


<p>This statement could occur anywhere in the same class that includes the
definition of <span class="code">playGame()</span>, whether in a <span class="code">main()</span> method or in
some other subroutine. Since <span class="code">playGame()</span> is a <span class="code">public</span> method,
it can also be called from other classes, but in that case, you have to tell
the computer which class it comes from.  Since <span class="code">playGame()</span> is a <span class="code">static</span> method,
its full name includes the name of the class in which it is defined.  Let's say, for example, that
<span class="code">playGame()</span> is defined in a class named <span class="code">Poker</span>. Then to call
<span class="code">playGame()</span> from <b>outside</b> the <span class="code">Poker</span> class, you would
have to say</p>


<pre>Poker.playGame();</pre>


<p>The use of the class name here tells the computer which class to look in to
find the method.  It also lets you distinguish between <span class="code">Poker.playGame()</span>
and other potential <span class="code">playGame()</span> methods defined in other classes, such
as <span class="code">Roulette.playGame()</span> or <span class="code">Blackjack.playGame()</span>.</p>


<p>More generally, a <span class="newword">subroutine call statement</span> for a <span class="code">static</span>
subroutine takes the form</p>


<pre><span class="bnf">subroutine-name</span>(<span class="bnf">parameters</span>);</pre>


<p>if the subroutine that is being called is in the same class, or</p>


<pre><span class="bnf">class-name</span>.<span class="bnf">subroutine-name</span>(<span class="bnf">parameters</span>);</pre>


<p>if the subroutine is defined elsewhere, in a different
class. (Non-static methods belong to objects rather than classes, and they are
called using objects instead of class names. More on that later.) Note
that the parameter list can be empty, as in the <span class="code">playGame()</span> example,
but the parentheses must be there even if there is nothing between them.
The number of parameters that you provide when you call a subroutine must
match the number specified in the parameter list in the subroutine definition,
and the types of the parameters in the call statement must match the types
in the subroutine definition.</p>
