</h3>


<p>
<span class="classname">String</span> is a class, and a value of type <span class="classname">String</span> is an object. 
That object contains data, namely the sequence of characters that make up the string. It also contains
subroutines. All of these subroutines are in fact functions. For example, every string object contains
a function named <span class="code">length</span>  that computes the number of characters in that string. Suppose
that <span class="code">advice</span> is a variable that refers to a <span class="classname">String</span>. For example,
<span class="code">advice</span> might have been declared and assigned a value as follows:</p>


<pre>String advice;
advice = "Seize the day!";</pre>


<p>Then <span class="code">advice.length()</span> is a function call that returns the number of
characters in the string "Seize the day!".  In this case, the return value would be 14.
In general, for any variable <span class="code">str</span> of type  <span class="classname">String</span>, 
the value of <span class="code">str.length()</span> is an
<span class="ptype">int</span> equal to the number of characters in the string.
Note that this function has no parameter; the particular string whose length
is being computed is the value of <span class="code">str</span>.  The <span class="code">length</span> subroutine is defined by
the class <span class="classname">String</span>, and it can be used with any value of type
<span class="classname">String</span>. It can even be used with <span class="classname">String</span> literals, which are,
after all, just constant values of type <span class="classname">String</span>. For example, you could
have a program count the characters in "Hello World" for you by saying</p>


<pre>System.out.print("The number of characters in ");
System.out.print("the string \"Hello World\" is ");
System.out.println( "Hello World".length() );</pre>


<p>The <span class="classname">String</span> class defines a lot of functions. Here are some that you
might find useful. Assume that <span class="code">s1</span> and <span class="code">s2</span> are variables of
type <span class="classname">String</span>:</p>


<ul>

<li>
<span class="code">s1.equals(s2)</span> is a function that returns a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value.
It returns <span class="code">true</span> if <span class="code">s1</span> consists of exactly the same sequence
of characters as <span class="code">s2</span>, and returns <span class="code">false</span> otherwise.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2)</span> is another boolean-valued function that
checks whether <span class="code">s1</span> is the same string as <span class="code">s2</span>, but this function
considers upper and lower case letters to be equivalent. Thus, if <span class="code">s1</span>
is "cat", then <span class="code">s1.equals("Cat")</span> is <span class="code">false</span>, while
<span class="code">s1.equalsIgnoreCase("Cat")</span> is <span class="code">true</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.length()</span>, as mentioned above, is an integer-valued function
that gives the number of characters in <span class="code">s1</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.charAt(N)</span>, where <span class="code">N</span> is an integer, returns a value of
type <span class="ptype">char</span>. It returns the Nth character in the string.
Positions are numbered starting with 0, so <span class="code">s1.charAt(0)</span> is actually
the first character, <span class="code">s1.charAt(1)</span> is the second, and so on. The final
position is <span class="code">s1.length()&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span>. For example, the value of
<span class="code">"cat".charAt(1)</span> is 'a'. An error occurs if the value of the parameter
is less than zero or is greater than or equal to <span class="code">s1.length()</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.substring(N,M)</span>, where <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span> are integers,
returns a value of type <span class="classname">String</span>. The returned value consists of the
characters of <span class="code">s1</span> in positions <span class="code">N</span>, <span class="code">N+1</span>,...,
<span class="code">M-1</span>. Note that the character in position <span class="code">M</span> is not included.
The returned value is called a substring of <span class="code">s1</span>.
The subroutine <span class="code">s1.substring(N)</span> returns the substring of <span class="code">s1</span>
consisting of characters starting at position <span class="code">N</span> up until the end of
the string.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.indexOf(s2)</span> returns an integer. If <span class="code">s2</span> occurs as a
substring of <span class="code">s1</span>, then the returned value is the starting position of
that substring. Otherwise, the returned value is -1. You can also use
<span class="code">s1.indexOf(ch)</span> to search for a <span class="ptype">char</span>, <span class="code">ch</span>, in
<span class="code">s1</span>. To find the first occurrence of <span class="code">x</span> at or after position
<span class="code">N</span>, you can use <span class="code">s1.indexOf(x,N)</span>.  To find the last occurance of
<span class="code">x</span> in <span class="code">s1</span>, use <span class="code">s1.lastIndexOf(x)</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.compareTo(s2)</span> is an integer-valued function that compares the
two strings. If the strings are equal, the value returned is zero. If
<span class="code">s1</span> is less than <span class="code">s2</span>, the value returned is a number less than
zero, and if <span class="code">s1</span> is greater than <span class="code">s2</span>, the value returned is
some number greater than zero. There is also a function <span class="code">s1.compareToIgnoreCase(s2)</span>.
(If both of the strings consist entirely of
lower case letters, or if they consist entirely of upper case letters, 
then "less than" and "greater than" refer to alphabetical
order. Otherwise, the ordering is more complicated.)</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.toUpperCase()</span> is a <span class="classname">String</span>-valued function that returns
a new string that is equal to <span class="code">s1</span>, except that any lower case letters
in <span class="code">s1</span> have been converted to upper case. For example,
<span class="code">"Cat".toUpperCase()</span> is the string <span class="code">"CAT"</span>. There is also a function
<span class="code">s1.toLowerCase()</span>.</li>


<li>
<span class="code">s1.trim()</span> is a <span class="classname">String</span>-valued function that returns a new
string that is equal to <span class="code">s1</span> except that any non-printing characters
such as spaces and tabs have been trimmed from the beginning and from the end
of the string. Thus, if <span class="code">s1</span> has the value <span class="code">"fred&nbsp;&nbsp;"</span>, then
<span class="code">s1.trim()</span> is the string <span class="code">"fred"</span>, with the spaces at the end removed.</li>

</ul>


<p>For the functions <span class="code">s1.toUpperCase()</span>, <span class="code">s1.toLowerCase()</span>, and
<span class="code">s1.trim()</span>, note that the value of <span class="code">s1</span> is <b>not</b> changed. Instead
a new string is created and returned as the value of the function. The returned
value could be used, for example, in an assignment statement such as "<span class="code">smallLetters =
s1.toLowerCase();</span>".  To change the value of <span class="code">s1</span>, you could
use an assignment "<span class="code">s1 = s1.toLowerCase();</span>".</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>Here is another extremely useful fact about strings: You can use the plus
operator, <span class="code">+</span>, to <span class="newword">concatenate</span> two strings. The
concatenation of two strings is a new string consisting of all the characters
of the first string followed by all the characters of the second string. For
example, <span class="code">"Hello" + "World"</span> evaluates to <span class="code">"HelloWorld"</span>. (Gotta watch those
spaces, of courseâ€”if you want a space in the concatenated string, it has to be
somewhere in the input data, as in <span class="code">"Hello&nbsp;" + "World"</span>.)</p>
   

<p>Let's suppose that <span class="code">name</span> is a variable of type
<span class="classname">String</span> and that it already refers to the name of the person using the
program. Then, the program could greet the user by executing the statement:</p>


<pre>System.out.println("Hello, "  +  name  +  ".  Pleased to meet you!");</pre>


<p>Even more surprising is that you can actually concatenate values of <b>any</b>
type onto a <span class="classname">String</span> using the <span class="code">+</span> operator. The value
is converted to a string, just as it would be if you printed it
to the standard output, and then that string is concatenated with the other string. For
example, the expression <span class="code">"Number"&nbsp;+&nbsp;42</span> evaluates to the string <span class="code">"Number42"</span>. And
the statements</p>


<pre>System.out.print("After ");
System.out.print(years);
System.out.print(" years, the value is ");
System.out.print(principal);</pre>


<p>can be replaced by the single statement:</p>


<pre>System.out.print("After " + years + 
                    " years, the value is " + principal);</pre>


<p>Obviously, this is very convenient. It would have shortened some of the
examples presented earlier in this chapter.</p>
