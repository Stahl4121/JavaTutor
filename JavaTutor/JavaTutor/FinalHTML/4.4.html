<p>Consider an application where the number of items that we want to store in
an array changes as the program runs. Since the size of the array can't
be changed, a separate counter variable must be used to keep track of
how many spaces in the array are in use. (Of course, every space in the array
has to contain something; the question is, how many spaces contain useful or
valid items?)</p>


<p>Consider, for example, a program that reads positive integers entered by the
user and stores them for later processing. The program stops reading when the
user inputs a number that is less than or equal to zero. The input numbers can
be kept in an array, <span class="code">numbers</span>, of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>. Let's say that
no more than 100 numbers will be input. Then the size of the array can be fixed
at 100. But the program must keep track of how many numbers have actually been
read and stored in the array. For this, it can use an integer variable.
Each time a number is stored in the array, we have to count it;
that is, value of the counter variable must be incremented by one. 
One question is, when we add a new item to the array, where do we put
it?  Well, if the number of items is <span class="code">count</span>, then they would
be stored in the array in positions number 0, 1, ..., (count-1).
The next open spot would be position number <span class="code">count</span>, so that's
where we should put the new item.</p>


<p>As a rather silly example, let's write a program that
will read the numbers input by the user and then print them in the reverse of the
order in which they were entered.  Assume that an input value equal to zero
marks the end of the data.
(This is, at least, a processing task that requires that the numbers be saved
in an array. Note that many types of processing, such as finding the sum or
average or maximum of the numbers, can be done without saving the individual
numbers.)</p>


<pre>import textio.TextIO;

public class ReverseInputNumbers {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
     int[] numbers;  // An array for storing the input values.
     int count;      // The number of numbers saved in the array.
     int num;        // One of the numbers input by the user.
     int i;          // for-loop variable.
     
     numbers = new int[100];   // Space for 100 ints.
     count = 0;                // No numbers have been saved yet.
     
     System.out.println("Enter up to 100 positive integers; enter 0 to end.");
     
     while (true) {   // Get the numbers and put them in the array.
        System.out.print("? ");
        num = TextIO.getlnInt();
        if (num &lt;= 0) {
              // Zero marks the end of input; we have all the numbers.
           break;
        }
        numbers[count] = num;  // Put num in position count.
        count++;  // Count the number
     }
     
     System.out.println("\nYour numbers in reverse order are:\n");
     
     for ( i = count - 1; i &gt;= 0; i-- ) {
         System.out.println( numbers[i] );
     }
     
   } // end main();
   
}  // end class ReverseInputNumbers</pre>


<p>It is especially important to note how the variable <span class="code">count</span> plays a
dual role. It is the number of items that have been entered into the array.
But it is also the index of the next available spot in the array.</p>


<p> When the time comes to print
out the numbers in the array, the last occupied spot in the array is location
<span class="code">count&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span>, so the <span class="code">for</span> loop prints out values starting from
location <span class="code">count&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span> and going down to 0.  This is also a nice
example of processing the elements of an array in reverse order.</p>
