</h3>


<p>It's time to give an example of what a complete program looks like, when it
includes other subroutines in addition to the <span class="code">main()</span> routine. Let's
write a program that plays a guessing game with the user. The computer will
choose a random number between 1 and 100, and the user will try to guess it.
The computer tells the user whether the guess is high or low or correct. If the
user gets the number after six guesses or fewer, the user wins the game. After
each game, the user has the option of continuing with another game.</p>


<p>Since playing one game can be thought of as a single, coherent task, it
makes sense to write a subroutine that will play one guessing game with the
user. The <span class="code">main()</span> routine will use a loop to call the
<span class="code">playGame()</span> subroutine over and over, as many times as the user wants
to play. We approach the problem of designing the <span class="code">playGame()</span>
subroutine the same way we write a <span class="code">main()</span> routine: Start with an
outline of the algorithm and apply stepwise refinement. Here is a short
pseudocode algorithm for a guessing game routine:</p>


<pre>Pick a random number
while the game is not over:
    Get the user's guess
    Tell the user whether the guess is high, low, or correct.</pre>


<p>The test for whether the game is over is complicated, since the game ends if
either the user makes a correct guess or the number of guesses is six. As in
many cases, the easiest thing to do is to use a "<span class="code">while&nbsp;(true)</span>" loop
and use <span class="code">break</span> to end the loop whenever we find a reason to do so.
Also, if we are going to end the game after six guesses, we'll have to keep
track of the number of guesses that the user has made. Filling out the
algorithm gives:</p>


<pre>Let computersNumber be a random number between 1 and 100
Let guessCount = 0
while (true):
    Get the user's guess
    Count the guess by adding 1 to guess count
    if the user's guess equals computersNumber:
        Tell the user he won
        break out of the loop
    if the number of guesses is 6:
        Tell the user he lost
        break out of the loop
    if the user's guess is less than computersNumber:
        Tell the user the guess was low
    else if the user's guess is higher than computersNumber:
        Tell the user the guess was high</pre>


<p>With variable declarations added and translated into Java, this becomes the
definition of the <span class="code">playGame()</span> routine. A random integer between 1 and
100 can be computed as <span class="code">(int)(100&nbsp;* Math.random())&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</span>. I've cleaned up
the interaction with the user to make it flow better.</p>


<pre>static void playGame() {
    int computersNumber; // A random number picked by the computer.
    int usersGuess;      // A number entered by user as a guess.
    int guessCount;      // Number of guesses the user has made.
    computersNumber = (int)(100 * Math.random()) + 1;
             // The value assigned to computersNumber is a randomly
             //    chosen integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
    guessCount = 0;
    System.out.println();
    System.out.print("What is your first guess? ");
    while (true) {
       usersGuess = TextIO.getInt();  // Get the user's guess.
       guessCount++;
       if (usersGuess == computersNumber) {
          System.out.println("You got it in " + guessCount
                  + " guesses!  My number was " + computersNumber);
          break;  // The game is over; the user has won.
       }
       if (guessCount == 6) {
          System.out.println("You didn't get the number in 6 guesses.");
          System.out.println("You lose.  My number was " + computersNumber);
          break;  // The game is over; the user has lost.
       }
       // If we get to this point, the game continues.
       // Tell the user if the guess was too high or too low.
       if (usersGuess &lt; computersNumber)
          System.out.print("That's too low.  Try again: ");
       else if (usersGuess &gt; computersNumber)
          System.out.print("That's too high.  Try again: ");
    }
    System.out.println();
} // end of playGame()</pre>


<p>Now, where exactly should you put this? It should be part of the same class
as the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, but <b>not</b> inside the main routine. It is not
legal to have one subroutine physically nested inside another. The
<span class="code">main()</span> routine will <b>call</b> <span class="code">playGame()</span>, but not contain
its definition, only a call statement. You can put the definition of <span class="code">playGame()</span> either before
or after the <span class="code">main()</span> routine. Java is not very picky about having the
subroutine definitions in a class in any particular order.</p>


<p>It's pretty easy to write the main routine. You've done things like this
before. Here's what the complete program looks like (except that a serious
program needs more comments than I've included here).</p>


<pre>import textio.TextIO;

public class GuessingGame {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Let's play a game.  I'll pick a number between");
      System.out.println("1 and 100, and you try to guess it.");
      boolean playAgain;
      do {
         playGame();  // call subroutine to play one game
         System.out.print("Would you like to play again? ");
         playAgain = TextIO.getlnBoolean();
      } while (playAgain);
      System.out.println("Thanks for playing.  Goodbye.");
   } // end of main()            
   
   static void playGame() {
       int computersNumber; // A random number picked by the computer.
       int usersGuess;      // A number entered by user as a guess.
       int guessCount;      // Number of guesses the user has made.
       computersNumber = (int)(100 * Math.random()) + 1;
                // The value assigned to computersNumber is a randomly
                //    chosen integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
       guessCount = 0;
       System.out.println();
       System.out.print("What is your first guess? ");
       while (true) {
          usersGuess = TextIO.getInt();  // Get the user's guess.
          guessCount++;
          if (usersGuess == computersNumber) {
             System.out.println("You got it in " + guessCount
                     + " guesses!  My number was " + computersNumber);
             break;  // The game is over; the user has won.
          }
          if (guessCount == 6) {
             System.out.println("You didn't get the number in 6 guesses.");
             System.out.println("You lose.  My number was " + computersNumber);
             break;  // The game is over; the user has lost.
          }
          // If we get to this point, the game continues.
          // Tell the user if the guess was too high or too low.
          if (usersGuess &lt; computersNumber)
             System.out.print("That's too low.  Try again: ");
          else if (usersGuess &gt; computersNumber)
             System.out.print("That's too high.  Try again: ");
       }
       System.out.println();
   } // end of playGame()
               
} // end of class GuessingGame</pre>


<p>Take some time to read the program carefully and figure out how it works.
And try to convince yourself that even in this relatively simple case, breaking
up the program into two methods makes the program easier to understand and
probably made it easier to write each piece.</p>
