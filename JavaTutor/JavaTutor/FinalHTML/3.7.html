<p>Control structures in Java are statements that contain other, simpler statements. In
particular, control structures can contain control structures. You've already
seen several examples of <span class="code">if</span> statements inside loops, and one example of
a <span class="code">while</span> loop inside another <span class="code">while</span>, but any
combination of one control structure inside another is possible. We say that
one structure is <span class="newword">nested</span> inside another. You can
even have multiple levels of nesting, such as a <span class="code">while</span> loop inside an
<span class="code">if</span> statement inside another <span class="code">while</span> loop. The syntax of Java
does not set a limit on the number of levels of nesting. As a practical matter,
though, it's difficult to understand a program that has more than a few levels
of nesting.</p>


<p>Nested <span class="code">for</span> loops arise naturally in many algorithms, and it is
important to understand how they work. Let's look at a couple of examples.
First, consider the problem of printing out a multiplication table like this
one:</p>


<pre> 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12
 2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20  22  24
 3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30  33  36
 4   8  12  16  20  24  28  32  36  40  44  48
 5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  55  60
 6  12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  60  66  72
 7  14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  70  77  84
 8  16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  80  88  96
 9  18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81  90  99 108
10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90 100 110 120
11  22  33  44  55  66  77  88  99 110 121 132
12  24  36  48  60  72  84  96 108 120 132 144</pre>


<p>The data in the table are arranged into 12 rows and 12 columns. The process
of printing them out can be expressed in a pseudocode algorithm as</p>


<pre>for each rowNumber = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12:
   Print the first twelve multiples of rowNumber on one line
   Output a carriage return</pre>


<p>The first step in the <span class="code">for</span> loop can itself be expressed as a
<span class="code">for</span> loop.  We can expand "Print the first twelve multiples of <span class="code">rowNumber</span> 
on one line" as:</p>


<pre>for N = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12:
   Print N * rowNumber</pre>


<p>so a refined algorithm for printing the table has one <span class="code">for</span> loop
nested inside another:</p>


<pre>for each rowNumber = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12:
   for N = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12:
      Print N * rowNumber
   Output a carriage return</pre>


<p>We want to print the output in neat columns, with each output number
taking up four spaces. This can be done using formatted output with format specifier <span class="code">%4d</span>.
Assuming that <span class="code">rowNumber</span> and <span class="code">N</span> have been declared to be
variables of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, the algorithm can be expressed in Java as</p>


<pre>for ( rowNumber = 1;  rowNumber &lt;= 12;  rowNumber++ ) {
   for ( N = 1;  N &lt;= 12;  N++ ) {
               // print in 4-character columns
      System.out.printf( "%4d", N * rowNumber );  // No carriage return !
   }
   System.out.println();  // Add a carriage return at end of the line.
}</pre>


<p>This section has been weighed down with lots of examples of numerical
processing. For our next example, let's do some text processing. Consider the
problem of finding which of the 26 letters of the alphabet occur in a given
string. For example, the letters that occur in "Hello World" are D, E, H, L, O,
R, and W. More specifically, we will write a program that will list all the
letters contained in a string and will also count the number of different
letters. The string will be input by the user. Let's start with a pseudocode
algorithm for the program.</p>


<pre>Ask the user to input a string
Read the response into a variable, str
Let count = 0  (for counting the number of different letters)
for each letter of the alphabet:
   if the letter occurs in str:
      Print the letter
      Add 1 to count
Output the count</pre>


<p>Since we want to process the entire line of text that is entered by the
user, we'll use <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> to read it. The line of the algorithm
that reads "for each letter of the alphabet" can be expressed as "<span class="code">for
(letter='A'; letter&lt;='Z'; letter++)</span>". But the <span class="code">if</span> statement inside the <span class="code">for</span>
loop needs still more thought before we can write the program. How do we check whether the given letter,
<span class="code">letter</span>, occurs in <span class="code">str</span>? One idea is to look at each character in
the string in turn, and check whether that character is equal to <span class="code">letter</span>.
We can get the <span class="code">i</span>-th character of <span class="code">str</span> with the function call
<span class="code">str.charAt(i)</span>, where <span class="code">i</span> ranges from 0 to <span class="code">str.length()&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span>.</p>


<p>One more difficulty: A letter such as 'A' can occur in <span class="code">str</span> in
either upper or lower case, 'A' or 'a'. We have to check for both of these. But
we can avoid this difficulty by converting <span class="code">str</span> to upper case before
processing it. Then, we only have to check for the upper case letter. We can
now flesh out the algorithm fully:</p>


<pre>Ask the user to input a string
Read the response into a variable, str
Convert str to upper case
Let count = 0
for letter = 'A', 'B', ..., 'Z':
    for i = 0, 1, ..., str.length()-1:
        if letter == str.charAt(i):
            Print letter
            Add 1 to count
            break  // jump out of the loop, to avoid counting letter twice
Output the count</pre>


<p>Note the use of <span class="code">break</span> in the nested
<span class="code">for</span> loop. It is required to avoid printing or counting a given letter
more than once (in the case where it occurs more than once in the string). 
The <span class="code">break</span> statement breaks out of the inner
<span class="code">for</span> loop, but not the outer <span class="code">for</span> loop.  Upon executing the
<span class="code">break</span>, the computer continues the outer loop with the next value of
<span class="code">letter</span>.  You should try to figure out exactly what <span class="code">count</span>
would be at the end of this program, if the <span class="code">break</span> statement were omitted.
Here is the complete program:</p>



<pre>import textio.TextIO;

/**
 * This program reads a line of text entered by the user.
 * It prints a list of the letters that occur in the text,
 * and it reports how many different letters were found.
 */
public class ListLetters {
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
   
      String str;  // Line of text entered by the user.
      int count;   // Number of different letters found in str.
      char letter; // A letter of the alphabet.
      
      System.out.println("Please type in a line of text.");
      str = TextIO.getln();
      
      str = str.toUpperCase();
      
      count = 0;
      System.out.println("Your input contains the following letters:");
      System.out.println();
      System.out.print("   ");
      for ( letter = 'A'; letter &lt;= 'Z'; letter++ ) {
          int i;  // Position of a character in str.
          for ( i = 0; i &lt; str.length(); i++ ) {
              if ( letter == str.charAt(i) ) {
                  System.out.print(letter);
                  System.out.print(' ');
                  count++;
                  break;
              }
          }
      }
      
      System.out.println();
      System.out.println();
      System.out.println("There were " + count + " different letters.");
   
   } // end main()
   
} // end class ListLetters
</pre>

   

<p>In fact, there is actually an easier way to determine whether a given letter occurs
in a string, <span class="code">str</span>. The built-in function <span class="code">str.indexOf(letter)</span>
will return <span class="code">-1</span> if <span class="code">letter</span> does <b>not</b> occur in
the string. It returns a number greater than or equal to zero if it does occur.
So, we could check whether <span class="code">letter</span> occurs in <span class="code">str</span> simply by
checking "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(str.indexOf(letter)&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0)</span>". If we used this technique
in the above program, we wouldn't need a nested <span class="code">for</span> loop. This gives
you a preview of how subroutines can be used to deal with complexity.</p>
