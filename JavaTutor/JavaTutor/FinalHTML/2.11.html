<p>
<span class="start"><big>T</big>his section takes a closer look</span> at expressions.
Recall that an expression is a piece of program code that represents or
computes a value. An expression can be a literal, a variable, a function call,
or several of these things combined with operators such as <span class="code">+</span>
and&nbsp;<span class="code">&gt;</span>. The value of an expression can be assigned to a variable, used
as a parameter in a  subroutine call, or combined with other values into a
more complicated expression. (The value can even, in some cases, be ignored, if
that's what you want to do; this is more common than you might think.)
Expressions are an essential part of programming. So far, this book has
dealt only informally with expressions. This section tells you the more-or-less
complete story (leaving out some of the less commonly used operators).</p>


<p>The basic building blocks of expressions are literals (such as <span class="code">674</span>,
<span class="code">3.14</span>, <span class="code">true</span>, and <span class="code">'X'</span>), variables, and function calls.
Recall that a function is a subroutine that returns a value. You've already
seen some examples of functions, such as the input routines from the <span class="classname">TextIO</span>
class and the mathematical functions from the <span class="classname">Math</span> class.
</p>
   

<p>The <span class="classname">Math</span> class also contains a couple of mathematical constants
that are useful in mathematical expressions:  <span class="code">Math.PI</span> represents
Ï€ (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
diameter), and <span class="code">Math.E</span> represents <i>e</i> (the base of the natural
logarithms).  These "constants" are actually member variables in 
<span class="classname">Math</span> of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.  They are only
approximations for the mathematical constants, which would require an infinite
number of digits to specify exactly.  The standard class <span class="classname">Integer</span>
contains a couple of constants related to the <span class="ptype">int</span> data type:
<span class="code">Integer.MAX_VALUE</span> is the largest possible <span class="ptype">int</span>,
2147483647, and <span class="code">Integer.MIN_VALUE</span> is the smallest <span class="ptype">int</span>,
-2147483648.  Similarly, the class <span class="classname">Double</span> contains some
constants related to type <span class="ptype">double</span>.  <span class="code">Double.MAX_VALUE</span>
is the largest value of type <span class="ptype">double</span>, and <span class="code">Double.MIN_VALUE</span>
is the smallest <b>positive</b> value.  It also has constants to represent infinite
values, <span class="code">Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</span> and <span class="code">Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</span>,
and the special value <span class="code">Double.NaN</span> to represent an undefined value.  For
example, the value of <span class="code">Math.sqrt(-1)</span> is <span class="code">Double.NaN</span>.
</p>


<p>Literals, variables, and function calls are simple expressions. More complex
expressions can be built up by using <span class="newword">operators</span> to
combine simpler expressions. Operators include <span class="code">+</span> for adding two
numbers, <span class="code">&gt;</span> for comparing two values, and so on. When several
operators appear in an expression, there is a question of <span class="newword">precedence</span>, 
which determines how the operators are grouped for
evaluation. For example, in the expression "<span class="code">A&nbsp;+&nbsp;B&nbsp;*&nbsp;C</span>", <span class="code">B*C</span>
is computed first and then the result is added to <span class="code">A</span>. We say that
multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>) has <span class="newword">higher precedence</span>
than addition (<span class="code">+</span>). If the default precedence is not what you want, you
can use parentheses to explicitly specify the grouping you want. For example,
you could use "<span class="code">(A&nbsp;+&nbsp;B)&nbsp;*&nbsp;C</span>" if you want to add <span class="code">A</span> to
<span class="code">B</span> first and then multiply the result by <span class="code">C</span>.</p>


<p>The rest of this section gives details of operators in Java. The number of
operators in Java is quite large.  I will not cover them all here, but most of
the important ones are here.</p>

<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="basics.5.1">2.5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Arithmetic Operators</a>
</h3>


<p>Arithmetic operators include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. They are indicated by <span class="code">+</span>, <span class="code">-</span>, <span class="code">*</span>, and
<span class="code">/</span>. These operations can be used on values of any numeric type:
<span class="ptype">byte</span>, <span class="ptype">short</span>, <span class="ptype">int</span>, <span class="ptype">long</span>, <span class="ptype">float</span>, or
<span class="ptype">double</span>.  (They can also be used with values of type <span class="ptype">char</span>, which
are treated as integers in this context;
a <span class="ptype">char</span> is converted into its Unicode code number when it is used with an
arithmetic operator.)  When the computer actually calculates one of these operations,
the two values that it combines must be of the same type. If your program tells
the computer to combine two values of different types, the computer will
convert one of the values from one type to another. For example, to compute
37.4&nbsp;+&nbsp;10, the computer will convert the integer 10 to a real number 10.0 and
will then compute 37.4&nbsp;+&nbsp;10.0.  This is called a <span class="newword">type conversion</span>.
Ordinarily, you don't have to worry about type conversion in expressions,
because the computer does it automatically.</p>


<p>When two numerical values are combined (after doing type conversion on one
of them, if necessary), the answer will be of the same type. If you multiply
two <span class="ptype">ints</span>, you get an <span class="ptype">int</span>; if you multiply two
<span class="ptype">doubles</span>, you get a <span class="ptype">double</span>. This is what you would expect, but
you have to be very careful when you use the division operator <span class="code">/</span>. When
you divide two integers, the answer will always be an integer; if the quotient
has a fractional part, it is discarded. For example, the value of <span class="code">7/2</span>
is <span class="code">3</span>, not <span class="code">3.5</span>. If <span class="code">N</span> is an integer variable, then
<span class="code">N/100</span> is an integer, and <span class="code">1/N</span> is equal to zero for any
<span class="code">N</span> greater than one! This fact is a common source of programming
errors. You can force the computer to compute a real number as the answer by
making one of the operands real: For example, when the computer evaluates
<span class="code">1.0/N</span>, it first converts <span class="code">N</span> to a real number in order to match
the type of <span class="code">1.0</span>, so you get a real number as the answer.
</p>


<p>Java also has an operator for computing the remainder when one number is
divided by another. This operator is indicated by <span class="code">%</span>. If <span class="code">A</span> and
<span class="code">B</span> are integers, then <span class="code">A&nbsp;%&nbsp;B</span> represents the remainder when
<span class="code">A</span> is divided by <span class="code">B</span>. 
(However, for negative operands, <span class="code">%</span> is not quite the
same as the usual mathematical "modulus" operator, since if one of <span class="code">A</span> or
<span class="code">B</span> is negative, then the value of <span class="code">A&nbsp;%&nbsp;B</span> will be negative.)
For example, <span class="code">7&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</span> is <span class="code">1</span>,
while <span class="code">34577&nbsp;%&nbsp;100</span> is <span class="code">77</span>, and <span class="code">50&nbsp;%&nbsp;8</span> is <span class="code">2</span>. A
common use of <span class="code">%</span> is to test whether a given integer is even or odd:
<span class="code">N</span> is even if <span class="code">N&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</span> is zero, and it is odd if <span class="code">N&nbsp;%&nbsp;2</span>
is <span class="code">1</span>. More generally, you can check whether an integer <span class="code">N</span> is
evenly divisible by an integer <span class="code">M</span> by checking whether
<span class="code">N&nbsp;%&nbsp;M</span> is zero.</p>


<p>The <span class="code">%</span> operator also works with real numbers.
In general, <span class="code">A&nbsp;%&nbsp;B</span> is what is left over after you remove as many copies of <span class="code">B</span>
as possible from <span class="code">A</span>.  For example, <span class="code">7.52&nbsp;%&nbsp;0.5</span> is 0.02.</p>


<p>Finally, you might need the <span class="newword">unary minus</span>
operator, which takes the negative of a number. For example, <span class="code">-X</span> has
the same value as <span class="code">(-1)*X</span>. For completeness, Java also has a unary plus
operator, as in <span class="code">+X</span>, even though it doesn't really do anything.</p>


<p>By the way, recall that the <span class="code">+</span> operator can also be used to concatenate
a value of any type onto a <span class="classname">String</span>.  When you use <span class="code">+</span> to combine
a string with a value of some other type, it is another example of
type conversion, since any type can be automatically converted into type
<span class="classname">String</span>.</p>
