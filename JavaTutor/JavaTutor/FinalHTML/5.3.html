<hr class="break">


<p>
<span class="start"><big>E</big>very subroutine in Java</span> must be defined inside
some class. This makes Java rather unusual among programming languages, since
most languages allow free-floating, independent subroutines. One purpose of a
class is to group together related subroutines and variables. Perhaps the
designers of Java felt that everything must be related to something. As a less
philosophical motivation, Java's designers wanted to place firm controls on the
ways things are named, since a Java program potentially has access to a huge
number of subroutines created by many different programmers. The fact that those
subroutines are grouped into named classes (and classes are grouped into named
"packages," as we will see later) helps control the confusion that might result from so many
different names.</p>


<p>There is a basic distinction in Java between <span class="newword">static</span> and
<span class="newword">non-static</span> subroutines.  A class definition can contain the
source code for both types of subroutine, but what's done with them when the
program runs is very different.  Static subroutines are easier to understand:
In a running program, a static subroutine is a member of the class itself.
Non-static subroutine definitions, on the other hand, are only there to be used
when objects are created, and the subroutines themselves become members of the
objects.  Non-static subroutines only become relevant when you are working 
with objects.  The distinction between static and non-static also applies to variables
and to other things that can occur in class definitions.  This chapter will
deal with static subroutines and static variables almost exclusively. We'll turn to non-static
stuff and to object-oriented programming in the <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c5/index.html">next
chapter</a>.</p>


<p>A subroutine that is in a class or object is often called a <span class="newword">method</span>, 
and "method" is the term that most people prefer for
subroutines in Java. I will start using the term "method" occasionally,
but I will continue to prefer the more general term "subroutine" 
in this chapter, at least for static subroutines.  However, you should start
thinking of the terms "method" and "subroutine" as being essentially
synonymous as far as Java is concerned.  Other terms that you might see used to 
refer to subroutines are "procedures" and "functions."  (I generally use the term
"function" only for subroutines that compute and return a value, but in some programming
languages, it is used to refer to subroutines in general.)</p>



<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="subroutines.2.1">4.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Subroutine Definitions</a>
</h3>


<p>A subroutine must be defined somewhere.  The definition has to include the name of the subroutine,
enough information to make it possible to call the subroutine, and the code that will be executed
each time the subroutine is called.  A subroutine definition in Java takes the form:</p>


<pre><span class="bnf">modifiers</span>  <span class="bnf">return-type</span>  <span class="bnf">subroutine-name</span>  ( <span class="bnf">parameter-list</span> ) {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</pre>


<p>It will take us a while—most of the chapter—to get through what all
this means in detail. Of course, you've already seen examples of subroutines in
previous chapters, such as the <span class="code">main()</span> routine of a program and the
<span class="code">drawFrame()</span> routine of the animation programs in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c3/s9.html">Section&nbsp;3.9</a>. 
So you are familiar with the general format.</p>


<p>The <span class="bnf">statements</span> between the braces, { and }, in a subroutine definition
make up the <span class="newword">body</span> of the subroutine. These
statements are the inside, or implementation part, of the "black box," as
discussed in the <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c4/s1.html">previous section</a>. They are the
instructions that the computer executes when the method is called. Subroutines
can contain any of the statements discussed in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c2/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> and
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c3/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>.</p>


<p>The <span class="bnf">modifiers</span> that can occur at the
beginning of a subroutine definition are words that set certain characteristics
of the subroutine, such as whether it is static or not. The modifiers that you've
seen so far are "<span class="code">static</span>" and "<span class="code">public</span>". There are only about a
half-dozen possible modifiers altogether.</p>


<p>If the subroutine is a function, whose job is to compute some value, then
the <span class="bnf">return-type</span> is used to specify the type of
value that is returned by the function.  It can be a type name such as
<span class="classname">String</span> or <span class="ptype">int</span> or even an array type
such as <span class="atype">double[]</span>.  We'll be looking at functions and
return types in some detail in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c4/s4.html">Section&nbsp;4.4</a>. If the
subroutine is not a function, then the <span class="bnf">return-type</span> is replaced 
by the special value <span class="code">void</span>,
which indicates that no value is returned. The term "void" is meant to indicate
that the return value is empty or non-existent.</p>


<p>Finally, we come to the <span class="bnf">parameter-list</span> of
the method. Parameters are part of the interface of a subroutine. They
represent information that is passed into the subroutine from outside, to be
used by the subroutine's internal computations. For a concrete example, imagine
a class named <span class="classname">Television</span> that includes a method named
<span class="code">changeChannel()</span>. The immediate question is: What channel should it
change to? A parameter can be used to answer this question. If a channel
number is an integer, the type of the parameter would be <span class="ptype">int</span>, and the
declaration of the <span class="code">changeChannel()</span> method might look like</p>


<pre>public void changeChannel(int channelNum) { ... }</pre>


<p>This declaration specifies that <span class="code">changeChannel()</span> has a parameter
named <span class="code">channelNum</span> of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. However, <span class="code">channelNum</span>
does not yet have any particular value. A value for <span class="code">channelNum</span> is
provided when the subroutine is called; for example:
<span class="code">changeChannel(17);</span>
</p>


<p>The parameter list in a subroutine can be empty, or it can consist of one or
more parameter declarations of the form <span class="bnf">type</span>&nbsp;<span class="bnf">parameter-name</span>. If there are several
declarations, they are separated by commas. Note that each declaration can name
only one parameter. For example, if you want two parameters of type
<span class="ptype">double</span>, you have to say "<span class="code">double&nbsp;x,&nbsp;double&nbsp;y</span>", rather than
"<span class="code">double&nbsp;x,&nbsp;y</span>".</p>


<p>Parameters are covered in more detail in the <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c4/s3.html">next section</a>.</p>


<p>Here are a few examples of subroutine definitions, leaving out the
statements that define what the subroutines do:</p>


<pre>public static void playGame() {
    // "public" and "static" are modifiers; "void" is the 
    // return-type; "playGame" is the subroutine-name; 
    // the parameter-list is empty.
    . . .  // Statements that define what playGame does go here.
}

int getNextN(int N) {
    // There are no modifiers; "int" in the return-type;
    // "getNextN" is the subroutine-name; the parameter-list 
    // includes one parameter whose name is "N" and whose 
    // type is "int".
    . . .  // Statements that define what getNextN does go here.
}

static boolean lessThan(double x, double y) {
    // "static" is a modifier; "boolean" is the
    // return-type; "lessThan" is the subroutine-name; 
    // the parameter-list includes two parameters whose names are 
    // "x" and "y", and the type of each of these parameters 
    // is "double".
    . . .  // Statements that define what lessThan does go here.
}</pre>


<p>In the second example given here, <span class="code">getNextN</span> is a non-static method,
since its definition does not include the modifier "<span class="code">static</span>"—and so
it's not an example that we should be looking at in this chapter! The other
modifier shown in the examples is "<span class="code">public</span>". This modifier indicates
that the method can be called from anywhere in a program, even from outside the
class where the method is defined. There is another modifier,
"<span class="code">private</span>", which indicates that the method can be called
<b>only</b> from inside the same class. The modifiers <span class="code">public</span>
and <span class="code">private</span> are called <span class="newword">access specifiers</span>.
If no access specifier is given for a method, then by default, that method can
be called from anywhere in the package that contains the class, but not from
outside that package. (You will learn more about packages later in this
chapter, in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c4/s6.html">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>.)  There is one other access
modifier, <span class="code">protected</span>, which will only become relevant when we turn to
object-oriented programming in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c5/index.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.</p>


<p>Note, by the way, that the <span class="code">main()</span> routine of a program follows the
usual syntax rules for a subroutine. In</p>


<pre>public static void main(String[] args) { ... }</pre>


<p>the modifiers are <span class="code">public</span> and <span class="code">static</span>, the return type is
<span class="code">void</span>, the subroutine name is <span class="code">main</span>, and the parameter list is
"<span class="code">String[]&nbsp;args</span>".  In this case, the type for the parameter is
the array type <span class="atype">String[]</span>.</p>


<p>You've already had some experience with filling in the implementation of a
subroutine. In this chapter, you'll learn all about writing your own complete
subroutine definitions, including the interface part.</p>
