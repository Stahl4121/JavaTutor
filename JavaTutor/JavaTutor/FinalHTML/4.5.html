</h3>


<p>The arrays that we have considered so far are "one-dimensional."  This means that the
array consists of a sequence of elements that can be thought of as being laid out along a line.
It is also possible to have <span class="newword">two-dimensional arrays</span>, where the elements can
be laid out in a rectangular grid.  We consider them only briefly here, but will return
to the topic in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c7/s5.html">Section&nbsp;7.5</a>.</p>


<p>In a two-dimensional, or "2D," array, the elements can be
arranged in rows and columns.  Here, for example, is a 2D array of <span class="ptype">int</span>
that has five rows and seven columns:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="./sec3.8.5_files/two-d-array.png" width="" height="" alt="an array of its with 5 rows and 7 columns"></p>


<p>This 5-by-7 grid contains a total of 35 elements.
The rows in a 2D array are numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., up to the number of rows minus one.
Similarly, the columns are numbered from zero up to the number of columns minus one.  Each individual
element in the array can be picked out by specifying its row number and its column number.
(The illustration shown here is not what the array actually looks like in the computer's
memory, but it does show the logical structure of the array.)</p>


<p>In Java, the syntax for two-dimensional arrays is similar to the syntax for one-dimensional
arrays, except that an extra index is involved, since picking out an element requires both
a row number and a column number.  For example, if <span class="code">A</span> is a 2D array of <span class="ptype">int</span>, then
<span class="code">A[3][2]</span> would be the element in row&nbsp;3, column&nbsp;2.  That would pick out the
number 17 in the array shown above.  The type for <span class="code">A</span>
would be given as <span class="atype">int[][]</span>, with two pairs of empty brackets.  To declare the
array variable and create the array, you could say,</p>


<pre>int[][]  A;
A  =  new int[5][7];</pre>


<p>The second line creates a 2D array with 5 rows and 7 columns.  Two-dimensional arrays
are often processed using nested <span class="code">for</span> loops.  For example, the following code 
segment will print out the elements of <span class="code">A</span> in neat columns:</p>


<pre>int row, col;  // loop-control-variables for accessing rows and columns in A
for ( row = 0; row &lt; 5; row++ ) {
    for ( col = 0; col &lt; 7; col++ ) {
        System.out.printf( "%7d",  A[row][col] );
    }
    System.out.println();
}</pre>



<p>The base type of a 2D array can be anything, so you can have arrays of type
<span class="atype">double[][]</span>, <span class="atype">String[][]</span>, and so on.</p>


<p>There are some natural uses for 2D arrays.  For example,
a 2D array can be used to store the contents of the board in a game such as
chess or checkers.  And an example in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c4/s7.html#subroutines.6.3">Subsection&nbsp;4.7.3</a> uses a 2D array
to hold the colors of a grid of colored squares.  But sometimes 
two-dimensional arrays are used in problems in which the grid is
not so visually obvious. Consider a company that owns 25 stores. Suppose that
the company has data about the profit earned at each store for each month in
the year 2018. If the stores are numbered from 0 to 24, and if the twelve
months from January 2018 through December 2018 are numbered from 0 to 11, then
the profit data could be stored in an array, <span class="code">profit</span>, created as
follows:</p>


<pre>double[][]  profit;
profit  =  new double[25][12];</pre>


<p>
<span class="code">profit[3][2]</span> would be the amount of profit earned at store number 3
in March, and more generally, <span class="code">profit[storeNum][monthNum]</span> would be the
amount of profit earned in store number <span class="code">storeNum</span> in month number
<span class="code">monthNum</span> (where the numbering, remember, starts from zero).</p>


<p>Let's assume that the <span class="code">profit</span> array has already been filled with
data. This data can be processed in a lot of interesting ways. For example, the
total profit for the company—for the whole year from all its stores—can
be calculated by adding up all the entries in the array:</p>


<pre>double totalProfit;  // Company's total profit in 2014.
int store, month;  // variables for looping through the stores and the months
totalProfit = 0;
for ( store = 0; store &lt; 25; store++ ) {
   for ( month = 0; month &lt; 12; month++ )
      totalProfit += profit[store][month];
}</pre>


<p>Sometimes it is necessary to process a single row or a single column of an
array, not the entire array. For example, to compute the total profit earned by
the company in December, that is, in month number 11, you could use the
loop:</p>


<pre>double decemberProfit;
int storeNum;
decemberProfit = 0.0;
for ( storeNum = 0; storeNum &lt; 25; storeNum++ ) {
   decemberProfit += profit[storeNum][11];
}</pre>


<p>Two-dimensional arrays are sometimes useful, but they are much less common
than one-dimensional arrays.  Java actually allows arrays of even higher dimension,
but they are only rarely encountered in practice.</p>
