<a name="OOP.1.2">5.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Fundamentals of Objects</a>
</h3>
   

<p>So far, I've been talking mostly in generalities, and I haven't given you
much of an idea about what you have to put in a program if you want to work with objects.
Let's look at a specific example to see how it works. Consider this extremely
simplified version of a <span class="code">Student</span> class, which could be used to store
information about students taking a course:</p>


<pre>public class Student {

   public String name;  // Student's name.
   public double test1, test2, test3;   // Grades on three tests.
   
   public double getAverage() {  // compute average test grade
      return (test1 + test2 + test3) / 3;
   }
   
}  // end of class Student</pre>


<p>None of the members of this class are declared to be <span class="code">static</span>, so the
class exists only for creating objects. This class definition says that any
object that is an instance of the <span class="classname">Student</span> class will include instance
variables named <span class="code">name</span>, <span class="code">test1</span>, <span class="code">test2</span>, and
<span class="code">test3</span>, and it will include an instance method named
<span class="code">getAverage()</span>. The names and test grades in different objects will generally
have different values. When called for a particular student, the method
<span class="code">getAverage()</span> will compute an average using <b>that
student's</b> test grades. Different students can have different averages.
(Again, this is what it means to say that an instance method belongs to an
individual object, not to the class.)</p>


<p>In Java, a class is a <b>type</b>, similar to the built-in types
such as <span class="ptype">int</span> and <span class="ptype">boolean</span>. So, a class name can be used to
specify the type of a variable in a declaration statement, or the type of a formal
parameter, or the return type of a function. For example, a program could
define a variable named <span class="code">std</span> of type <span class="code">Student</span> with the
statement</p>


<pre>Student std;</pre>


<p>However, declaring a variable does <b>not</b> create an object!
This is an important point, which is related to this Very Important Fact:</p>


<div align="center">
<p>
<b>In Java, no variable can ever hold an object.<br>
A variable can only hold a reference to an object.</b>
</p>
</div>


<p>You should think of objects as floating around independently in the
computer's memory. In fact, there is a special portion of memory called the
<span class="newword">heap</span> where objects live. Instead of holding an
object itself, a variable holds the information necessary to find the object in
memory. This information is called a <span class="newword">reference</span> or
<span class="newword">pointer</span> to the object. In effect, a reference to
an object is the address of the memory location where the object is stored.
When you use a variable of object type, the computer uses the reference in the
variable to find the actual object.</p>


<p>In a program, objects are created using an operator called <span class="code">new</span>, which
creates an object and returns a reference to that object.  (In fact, the <span class="code">new</span> operator
calls a special subroutine called a "constructor" in the class.)
For example, assuming that <span class="code">std</span> is a variable of type <span class="code">Student</span>, declared as above,
the assignment statement</p>


<pre>std = new Student();</pre>


<p>would create a new object which is an instance of the class
<span class="code">Student</span>, and it would store a reference to that object in the variable
<span class="code">std</span>. The value of the variable is a reference, or pointer, to the object.
The object itself is somewhere in the heap.
It is not quite true, then, to say that the object is the "value
of the variable <span class="code">std</span>" (though sometimes it is hard to avoid using this
terminology). It is certainly <b>not at all true</b> to say that the
object is "stored in the variable <span class="code">std</span>." The proper terminology is that
"the variable <span class="code">std</span> <span class="newword">refers to</span> or <span class="newword">points to</span>
the object," and I will try to stick to that terminology as much as possible.
If I ever say something like "std <b>is</b> an object," you should read it as
meaning "std is a variable that refers to an object."</p>


<p>So, suppose that the variable <span class="code">std</span> refers to an object that is an instance of
class <span class="code">Student</span>. That object contains instance variables <span class="code">name</span>,
<span class="code">test1</span>, <span class="code">test2</span>, and <span class="code">test3</span>. These instance variables
can be referred to as <span class="code">std.name</span>, <span class="code">std.test1</span>,
<span class="code">std.test2</span>, and <span class="code">std.test3</span>. This follows the usual naming
convention that when <span class="code">B</span> is part of <span class="code">A</span>, then the full name of
<span class="code">B</span> is <span class="code">A.B</span>. For example, a program might include the lines</p>


<pre>System.out.println("Hello, "  +  std.name  +  ".  Your test grades are:");
System.out.println(std.test1);
System.out.println(std.test2);
System.out.println(std.test3);</pre>


<p>This would output the name and test grades from the object to which
<span class="code">std</span> refers. Similarly, <span class="code">std</span> can be used to call the
<span class="code">getAverage()</span> instance method in the object by saying
<span class="code">std.getAverage()</span>. To print out the student's average, you could
say:</p>


<pre>System.out.println( "Your average is "  +  std.getAverage() );</pre>


<p>More generally, you could use <span class="code">std.name</span> any place where a variable
of type <span class="classname">String</span> is legal. You can use it in expressions. You can assign
a value to it. You can even use it to call subroutines from the <span class="classname">String</span>
class. For example, <span class="code">std.name.length()</span> is the number of characters in
the student's name.</p>


<p>It is possible for a variable like <span class="code">std</span>, whose type is given by a
class, to refer to no object at all. We say in this case that <span class="code">std</span>
holds a <span class="newword">null pointer</span> or <span class="newword">null reference</span>. The null pointer is
written in Java as "<span class="code">null</span>". You can store a null reference in the
variable <span class="code">std</span> by saying</p>


<pre>std = null;</pre>


<p>
<span class="code">null</span> is an actual value that is stored in the variable, not a pointer
to something else.  It is <b>not</b> correct to say that the variable "points to null";
in fact, the variable <b>is</b> null.  For example,
you can test whether the value of <span class="code">std</span> is null by testing</p>


<pre>if (std == null) . . .</pre>


<p>If the value of a variable is <span class="code">null</span>, then it is, of course, illegal
to refer to instance variables or instance methods through that variableâ€”since
there <b>is</b> no object, and hence no instance variables to refer to!  For
example, if the value of the variable <span class="code">std</span> is <span class="code">null</span>, then it
would be illegal to refer to <span class="code">std.test1</span>. If your program attempts to
use a null pointer illegally in this way, the result is an error called a
<span class="newword">null pointer exception</span>.  When this happens while the program
is running, an exception of type <span class="classname">NullPointerException</span>
is thrown.
</p>


<p>Let's look at a sequence of statements that work with objects:</p>


<pre>Student std, std1,       // Declare four variables of
          std2, std3;    //   type Student.

std = new Student();     // Create a new object belonging
                         //   to the class Student, and
                         //   store a reference to that
                         //   object in the variable std.

std1 = new Student();    // Create a second Student object
                         //   and store a reference to
                         //   it in the variable std1.

std2 = std1;             // Copy the reference value in std1
                         //   into the variable std2.

std3 = null;             // Store a null reference in the
                         //   variable std3.
                         
std.name = "John Smith";  // Set values of some instance variables.
std1.name = "Mary Jones";

     // (Other instance variables have default
     //    initial values of zero.)</pre>


<p>After the computer executes these statements, the situation in the
computer's memory looks like this:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="./5.1.2_files/objects-in-heap.png" width="537" height="425" alt="Objects and variables created by the above code"></p>



<p>In this picture, when a variable
contains a reference to an object, the value of that variable is shown as an
arrow pointing to the object.   Note, by the way, that the <span class="classname">Strings</span>
are objects!  The variable <span class="code">std3</span>, with a value of
<span class="code">null</span>, doesn't point anywhere. The arrows from <span class="code">std1</span> and
<span class="code">std2</span> both point to the same object. This illustrates a Very Important
Point:</p>


<div align="center">
<p>
<b>When one object variable is assigned<br>
to another, only a reference is copied.<br>
The object referred to is not copied.</b>
</p>
</div>


<p>When the assignment "<span class="code">std2 = std1</span>;" was executed, no new object was
created. Instead, <span class="code">std2</span> was set to refer to the very same object that
<span class="code">std1</span> refers to.   This is to be expected, since the assignment
statement just copies the value that is stored in <span class="code">std1</span> into 
<span class="code">std2</span>, and that value is a pointer, not an object.
But this has some consequences that might be surprising.
For example, <span class="code">std1.name</span> and <span class="code">std2.name</span> are two different names for the
same variable, namely the instance variable in the object that both
<span class="code">std1</span> and <span class="code">std2</span> refer to. After the string <span class="code">"Mary
Jones"</span> is assigned to the variable <span class="code"><b>std1</b>.name</span>, it is also
true that the value of <span class="code"><b>std2</b>.name</span> is <span class="code">"Mary Jones"</span>.
There is a potential for a lot of confusion here, but you can help protect
yourself from it if you keep telling yourself, "The object is not in the
variable. The variable just holds a pointer to the object."</p>


<p>You can test objects for equality and inequality using the operators <span class="code">==</span> and
<span class="code">!=</span>, but here again, the semantics are different from what you are used to. When
you make a test "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(std1&nbsp;==&nbsp;std2)</span>", you are testing whether the
values stored in <span class="code">std1</span> and <span class="code">std2</span> are the same. But the values that you are comparing
are references to objects; they are not objects. So, you are testing whether
<span class="code">std1</span> and <span class="code">std2</span> refer to the same object, that is, whether they
point to the same location in memory. This is fine, if it's what you want to do.
But sometimes, what you want to check is whether the instance variables in the
objects have the same values. To do that, you would need to ask whether 
"<span class="code">std1.test1 == std2.test1 &amp;&amp; std1.test2 == std2.test2 &amp;&amp;
std1.test3 == std2.test3 &amp;&amp; std1.name.equals(std2.name)</span>".</p>


<p>I've remarked previously that <span class="classname">Strings</span> are objects, and I've shown
the strings <span class="code">"Mary Jones"</span> and <span class="code">"John Smith"</span> as objects in the
above illustration.  (Strings are special objects, treated by Java in a special way, and I
haven't attempted to show the actual internal structure of the <span class="classname">String</span> objects.)
Since strings are objects, a variable of type <span class="classname">String</span> can only hold a
reference to a string, not the string itself.  This
explains why using the <span class="code">==</span> operator to test strings for equality is not
a good idea. Suppose that <span class="code">greeting</span> is a variable of type
<span class="classname">String</span>, and that it refers to the string <span class="code">"Hello"</span>. Then
would the test <span class="code">greeting&nbsp;==&nbsp;"Hello"</span> be true? Well, maybe, maybe not.
The variable <span class="code">greeting</span> and the <span class="classname">String</span> literal <span class="code">"Hello"</span>
each refer to a string that contains the characters H-e-l-l-o. But the strings
could still be different objects, that just happen to contain the same
characters; in that case, <span class="code">greeting&nbsp;==&nbsp;"Hello"</span> would be false.
The function <span class="code">greeting.equals("Hello")</span> tests whether
<span class="code">greeting</span> and <span class="code">"Hello"</span> contain the same characters, which is
almost certainly the question you want to ask. The expression 
<span class="code">greeting&nbsp;==&nbsp;"Hello"</span> tests whether <span class="code">greeting</span> 
and <span class="code">"Hello"</span> contain the same characters <b>stored in the same memory location</b>.
(Of course, a <span class="classname">String</span> variable such as <span class="code">greeting</span>
can also contain the special value <span class="code">null</span>, and it <b>would</b> make
sense to use the <span class="code">==</span> operator to test whether "<span class="code">greeting&nbsp;==&nbsp;null</span>".)
</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>The fact that variables hold references to objects, not objects themselves,
has a couple of other consequences that you should be aware of. They follow
logically, if you just keep in mind the basic fact that the object is not
stored in the variable. The object is somewhere else; the variable points to it.</p>


<p>Suppose that a variable that refers to an object is declared to be
<span class="code">final</span>. This means that the value stored in the variable can never be
changed, once the variable has been initialized. The value stored in the
variable is a reference to the object. So the variable will continue to refer
to the same object as long as the variable exists. However, this does not
prevent the data <b>in the object</b> from changing. The variable is
<span class="code">final</span>, not the object. It's perfectly legal to say</p>


<pre>final Student stu = new Student();

stu.name = "John Doe";  // Change data in the object;
                        // The value stored in stu is not changed!
                        // It still refers to the same object.</pre>


<p>Next, suppose that <span class="code">obj</span> is a variable that refers to an object.
Let's consider what happens when <span class="code">obj</span> is passed as an actual parameter
to a subroutine. The value of <span class="code">obj</span> is assigned to a formal parameter in
the subroutine, and the subroutine is executed. The subroutine has no power to
change the value stored in the variable, <span class="code">obj</span>. It only has a copy of
that value. However, the value is a reference to an object. Since the
subroutine has a reference to the object, it can change the data stored <b>in</b> the
object. After the subroutine ends, <span class="code">obj</span> still points to the same
object, but the data stored <b>in the object</b> might have changed.
Suppose <span class="code">x</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span> and <span class="code">stu</span> is a
variable of type <span class="code">Student</span>. Compare:</p>


<pre>void dontChange(int z) {                void change(Student s) {
    z = 42;                                  s.name = "Fred";
}                                       }

<span class="newcode">The lines:                              The lines:</span>

   x = 17;                                 stu.name = "Jane";
   dontChange(x);                          change(stu);
   System.out.println(x);                  System.out.println(stu.name);
 
<span class="newcode">output the value 17.                    output the value "Fred".
 
The value of x is <b>not</b>                   The value of stu is not
changed by the subroutine,              changed, but stu.name <b>is</b> changed.
which is equivalent to                  This is equivalent to</span>

   z = x;                                  s = stu;
   z = 42;                                 s.name = "Fred";</pre>
