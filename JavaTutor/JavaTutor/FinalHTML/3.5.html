</h3>


<p>The syntax of the <span class="code">while</span> and <span class="code">do..while</span> loops allows you to
test the continuation condition at either the beginning of a loop or at the
end. Sometimes, it is more natural to have the test in the middle of the loop,
or to have several tests at different places in the same loop. Java provides a
general method for breaking out of the middle of any loop. It's called the
<span class="code">break</span> statement, which takes the form</p>


<pre>break;</pre>


<p>When the computer executes a <span class="code">break</span> statement in a loop, it will
immediately jump out of the loop. It then continues on to whatever follows the
loop in the program. Consider for example:</p>


<pre>while (true) {  // looks like it will run forever!
   System.out.print("Enter a positive number: ");
   N = TextIO.getlnInt();
   if (N &gt; 0)   // the input value is OK, so jump out of loop
      break;
   System.out.println("Your answer must be &gt; 0.");
}
// continue here after break</pre>


<p>If the number entered by the user is greater than zero, the <span class="code">break</span>
statement will be executed and the computer will jump out of the loop.
Otherwise, the computer will print out "Your answer must be &gt; 0." and will
jump back to the start of the loop to read another input value.</p>


<p>The first line of this loop, "<span class="code">while&nbsp;(true)</span>" might look a bit
strange, but it's perfectly legitimate. The condition in a <span class="code">while</span> loop
can be any boolean-valued expression. The computer evaluates this expression
and checks whether the value is <span class="code">true</span> or <span class="code">false</span>. The boolean
literal "<span class="code">true</span>" is just a boolean expression that always evaluates to
true. So "<span class="code">while&nbsp;(true)</span>" can be used to write an infinite loop, or one
that will be terminated by a <span class="code">break</span> statement.</p>


<p>A <span class="code">break</span> statement terminates the loop that immediately encloses the
<span class="code">break</span> statement. It is possible to have <span class="newword">nested</span> loops, 
where one loop statement is contained inside
another. If you use a <span class="code">break</span> statement inside a nested loop, it will
only break out of that loop, not out of the loop that contains the nested loop. 
There is something called a <span class="newword">labeled break</span> statement that allows you to
specify which loop you want to break. This is not very common, so I will go over it quickly.
Labels work like this:  You can put a <span class="newword">label</span> in
front of any loop.  A label consists of a simple identifier followed
by a colon.  For example, a <span class="code">while</span> with a label might
look like "<span class="code">mainloop:&nbsp;while...</span>".  Inside
this loop you can use the labeled break statement "<span class="code">break&nbsp;mainloop;</span>"
to break out of the labeled loop.  For example, here is a code segment that checks
whether two strings, <span class="code">s1</span> and <span class="code">s2</span>, have a character in common.
If a common character is found, the value of the flag variable <span class="code">nothingInCommon</span>
is set to <span class="code">false</span>, and a labeled break is used to end the processing
at that point:</p>


<pre>boolean nothingInCommon;
nothingInCommon = true;  // Assume s1 and s2 have no chars in common.
int i,j;  // Variables for iterating through the chars in s1 and s2.

i = 0;
bigloop: while (i &lt; s1.length()) {
   j = 0;
   while (j &lt; s2.length()) {
      if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) { // s1 and s2 have a common char...
          nothingInCommon = false;  // so nothingInCommon is actually false.
          break bigloop;  // break out of BOTH loops
      }
      j++;  // Go on to the next char in s2.
   }
   i++;  //Go on to the next char in s1.
}</pre>
