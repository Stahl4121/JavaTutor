<a name="subroutines.3.3">4.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Overloading</a>
</h3>


<p>In order to call a subroutine legally, you need to know its name, you need
to know how many formal parameters it has, and you need to know the type of
each parameter. This information is called the subroutine's <span class="newword">signature</span>.
The signature of the subroutine <span class="code">doTask</span>, used as an example above, can
be expressed as: <span class="code">doTask(int,double,boolean)</span>. Note that the signature does
<b>not</b> include the names of the parameters; in fact, if you just
want to <b>use</b> the subroutine, you don't even need to know what
the formal parameter names are, so the names are not part of the interface.</p>


<p>Java is somewhat unusual in that it allows two different subroutines in the
same class to have the same name, provided that their signatures are different.
When this happens, we say that
the name of the subroutine is <span class="newword">overloaded</span> because
it has several different meanings. The computer doesn't get the subroutines
mixed up. It can tell which one you want to call by the number and types of the
actual parameters that you provide in the subroutine call statement. You have
already seen overloading used with <span class="classname">System.out</span>. This object includes
many different methods named <span class="code">println</span>, for example. These methods all
have different signatures, such as:</p>


<pre>println(int)                   println(double)
println(char)                  println(boolean)
println()</pre>


<p>The computer knows which of these subroutines you want to use based on
the type of the actual parameter that you provide.  <span class="code">System.out.println(17)</span>
calls the subroutine with signature <span class="code">println(int)</span>, while
<span class="code">System.out.println('A')</span> calls the subroutine with signature <span class="code">println(char)</span>.
Of course all these different subroutines are semantically related, which is
why it is acceptable programming style to use the same name for them all. But
as far as the computer is concerned, printing out an <span class="ptype">int</span> is very
different from printing out a <span class="ptype">char</span>, which is different from printing
out a <span class="ptype">boolean</span>, and so forthâ€”so that each of these operations
requires a different subroutine.</p>


<p>Note, by the way, that the signature does <b>not</b> include the
subroutine's return type. It is illegal to have two subroutines in the same
class that have the same signature but that have different return types. For
example, it would be a syntax error for a class to contain two subroutines defined
as:</p>


<pre>int    getln() { ... }
double getln() { ... }</pre>


<p>This is why in the <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class, the subroutines
for reading different types are not all named <span class="code">getln()</span>. In a given
class, there can only be one routine that has the name <span class="code">getln</span> with
no parameters. So, the input routines in <span class="classname">TextIO</span> are distinguished by
having different names, such as <span class="code">getlnInt()</span> and
<span class="code">getlnDouble()</span>.</p>
