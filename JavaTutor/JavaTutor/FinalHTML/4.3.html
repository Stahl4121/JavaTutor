<p>A lot of the real power of arrays comes from the fact that
the index of an element can be given by an integer variable or
even an integer-valued expression.  For example, if <span class="code">list</span>
is an array and <span class="code">i</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span>,
then you can use <span class="code">list[i]</span> and even <span class="code">list[2*i+1]</span>
as variable names.  The meaning of <span class="code">list[i]</span> depends on
the value of <span class="code">i</span>.  This becomes especially useful when we want to
process all the elements of an array, since that can be
done with a <span class="code">for</span> loop.  For example, to print out
all the items in an array, <span class="code">list</span>, we can just
write</p>


<pre>int i;  // the array index
for (i = 0; i &lt; list.length; i++) {
    System.out.println( list[i] );
}</pre>


<p>The first time through the loop, <span class="code">i</span> is 0, and <span class="code">list[i]</span>
refers to <span class="code">list[0]</span>. So, it is the value stored in the variable
<span class="code">list[0]</span> that is printed. The second time through the loop, <span class="code">i</span>
is 1, and the value stored in <span class="code">list[1]</span> is printed. If the length of the list is 5, then the loop ends after
printing the value of <span class="code">list[4]</span>, when <span class="code">i</span> becomes equal to 5 and
the continuation condition "<span class="code">i&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;list.length</span>" is no longer true. This
is a typical example of using a loop to process an array.</p>


<p>Let's look at a few more examples.  Suppose that <span class="code">A</span> is an array
of <span class="ptype">double</span>, and we want to find the average of all the elements of
the array.  We can use a <span class="code">for</span> loop to add up the numbers, and then
divide by the length of the array to get the average:</p>


<pre>double total;    // The sum of the numbers in the array.
double average;  // The average of the numbers.
int i;  // The array index.
total = 0;
for ( i = 0; i &lt; A.length; i++ ) {
    total = total + A[i];  // Add element number i to the total.
}
average = total / A.length;  // A.length is the number of items</pre>


<p>Another typical problem is to find the largest number in the array <span class="code">A</span>. The
strategy is to go through the array, keeping track of the largest number found
so far. We'll store the largest number found so far in a variable called
<span class="code">max</span>. As we look through the array, whenever we find a number larger
than the current value of <span class="code">max</span>, we change the value of <span class="code">max</span> to
that larger value. After the whole array has been processed, <span class="code">max</span> is
the largest item in the array overall. The only question is, what should the
original value of <span class="code">max</span> be? One possibility is to start with
<span class="code">max</span> equal to <span class="code">A[0]</span>, and then to look through the rest of the
array, starting from <span class="code">A[1]</span>, for larger items:</p>


<pre>double max;  // The largest number seen so far.
max = A[0];   // At first, the largest number seen is A[0].
int i;
for ( i = 1; i &lt; A.length; i++ ) {
    if (A[i] &gt; max) {
       max = A[i];
    }
}
// at this point, max is the largest item in A</pre>


<p>Sometimes, you only want to process some elements of the array.  In that
case, you can use an <span class="code">if</span> statement inside the <span class="code">for</span>
loop to decide whether or not to process a given element.  Let's look
at the problem of averaging the elements of an array, but this time,
suppose that we only want to average the non-zero elements.  In this case,
the number of items that we add up can be less than the length of the array,
so we will need to keep a count of the number of items added to the sum:</p>


<pre>double total;    // The sum of the non-zero numbers in the array.
int count;       // The number of non-zero numbers.
double average;  // The average of the non-zero numbers.
int i;
total = 0;
count = 0;
for ( i = 0; i &lt; A.length; i++ ) {
    if ( A[i] != 0 ) {
        total = total + A[i];  // Add element to the total
        count = count + 1;     //      and count it.
    }
}
if (count == 0) {
    System.out.println("There were no non-zero elements.");
}
else {
    average = total / count;  // Divide by number of items
    System.out.printf("Average of %d elements is %1.5g%n",
                            count, average);
}</pre>
