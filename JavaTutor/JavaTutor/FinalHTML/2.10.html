<a name="basics.4.6">2.4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Using Scanner for Input</a>
</h3>


<p>
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> makes it easy to get input from the user.
However, since it is not a standard class, you have to remember to make
<span class="code">TextIO.java</span> available to any program that uses it.  Another option for input
is the <span class="classname">Scanner</span> class.
One advantage of using <span class="classname">Scanner</span> is that it's
a standard part of Java and so is always there when you want it.</p>


<p>It's not that hard to use a <span class="classname">Scanner</span> for user input, and it has
some nice features, but using it requires some
syntax that will not be introduced until Chapter&nbsp;4</a> and 
Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.  I'll tell you how to do it here, without explaining why
it works.  You won't understand all the syntax at this point.
(<span class="classname">Scanners</span> will be covered in more detail in Subsection&nbsp;11.1.5</a>.)</p>


<p>First, since <span class="classname">Scanner</span> is defined in the package <span class="classname">java.util</span>,
you should add the following
import directive to your program at the beginning of the source code file, before the "public class...":</p>


<pre>import java.util.Scanner;</pre>


<p>Then include the following statement at the beginning of your <span class="code">main()</span> routine:</p>


<pre>Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );</pre>


<p>This creates a variable named <span class="code">stdin</span> of type <span class="classname">Scanner</span>.
(You can use a different name for the variable if you want; "stdin" stands for "standard input.")
You can then use <span class="code">stdin</span> in your program to access a variety of subroutines for
reading user input.  For example, the function <span class="code">stdin.nextInt()</span> reads one value of type
<span class="ptype">int</span> from the user and returns it.  It is almost the same as <span class="code">TextIO.getInt()</span>
except for two things:  If the value entered by the user is not a legal <span class="ptype">int</span>, then
<span class="code">stdin.nextInt()</span> will crash rather than prompt the user to re-enter the value.
And the integer entered by the user must be followed by a blank space or by an end-of-line,
whereas <span class="code">TextIO.getInt()</span> will stop reading at any character that is not a digit.
</p>


<p>There are corresponding methods for reading other types of data, including
<span class="code">stdin.nextDouble()</span>, <span class="code">stdin.nextLong()</span>, and <span class="code">stdin.nextBoolean()</span>.
(<span class="code">stdin.nextBoolean()</span> will only accept "true" or "false" as input.)  These subroutines
can read more than one value from a line, so they are more similar to the "get" versions of
<span class="classname">TextIO</span> subroutines rather than the "getln" versions.  The method
<span class="code">stdin.nextLine()</span> is equivalent to <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span>, and
<span class="code">stdin.next()</span>, like <span class="code">TextIO.getWord()</span>, returns a string of 
non-blank characters.</p>


<p>As a simple example, here is a sample program that uses <span class="classname">Scanner</span> instead of <span class="classname">TextIO</span> for user
input:
</p>


<pre><span class="newcode">import java.util.Scanner;</span>

public class Interest2WithScanner {
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      
      <span class="newcode">Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );</span>  // Create the Scanner.
      
      double principal;  // The value of the investment.
      double rate;       // The annual interest rate.
      double interest;   // The interest earned during the year.
      
      System.out.print("Enter the initial investment: ");
      <span class="newcode">principal = stdin.nextDouble();</span>
      
      System.out.print("Enter the annual interest rate (as a decimal): ");
      <span class="newcode">rate = stdin.nextDouble();</span>
      
      interest = principal * rate;       // Compute this year's interest.
      principal = principal + interest;  // Add it to principal.
      
      System.out.printf("The amount of interest is $%1.2f%n", interest);
      System.out.printf("The value after one year is $%1.2f%n", principal);
      
   } // end of main()
   
} // end of class Interest2WithScanner</pre>


<p>Note the inclusion of the two lines given above to import <span class="code">Scanner</span> and
create <span class="code">stdin</span>.  Also note the substitution of
<span class="code">stdin.nextDouble()</span> for <span class="code">TextIO.getlnDouble()</span>.  (In fact,
<span class="code">stdin.nextDouble()</span> is really equivalent to <span class="code">TextIO.getDouble()</span>
rather than to the "getln" version, but this will not affect the behavior of the
program as long as the user types just one number on each line of input.)</p>


<p>I will continue to use <span class="classname">TextIO</span> for input for the time
being, but I will give a few more examples of using <span class="classname">Scanner</span>
in the on-line solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises.  There will be more
detailed coverage of <span class="classname">Scanner</span> later.</p>
