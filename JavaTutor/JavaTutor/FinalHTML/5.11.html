<a name="subroutines.4.2">4.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Function Examples</a>
</h3>


<p>Here is a very simple function that could be used in a program to compute
3N+1 sequences. (The 3N+1 sequence problem is one we've looked at several times
already, including in the <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c4/s3.html">previous section</a>.)
Given one term in a 3N+1 sequence, this function computes the next
term of the sequence:</p>
 

<pre>static int nextN(int currentN) {
   if (currentN % 2 == 1)     // test if current N is odd
      return 3*currentN + 1;  // if so, return this value
   else
      return currentN / 2;    // if not, return this instead
}</pre>


<p>This function has two <span class="code">return</span> statements.
Exactly one of the two <span class="code">return</span> statements is executed to give the
value of the function.  Some people prefer to use a single <span class="code">return</span>
statement at the very end of the function when possible. This allows the reader to find the
<span class="code">return</span> statement easily. You might choose to write <span class="code">nextN()</span>
like this, for example:</p>


<pre>static int nextN(int currentN) {
   int answer;  // answer will be the value returned
   if (currentN % 2 == 1)    // test if current N is odd
      answer = 3*currentN+1; // if so, this is the answer
   else
      answer = currentN / 2; // if not, this is the answer
   return answer;   // (Don't forget to return the answer!)
}</pre>


<p>Here is a subroutine that uses this <span class="code">nextN</span> function. In this case,
the improvement from the version of the subroutine in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c4/s3.html">Section&nbsp;4.3</a> is not
great, but if <span class="code">nextN()</span> were a long function that performed a complex
computation, then it would make a lot of sense to hide that complexity inside a
function:</p>


<pre>static void print3NSequence(int startingValue) {
 
   int N;       // One of the terms in the sequence.
   int count;   // The number of terms found.
   
   N = startingValue;   // Start the sequence with startingValue.
   count = 1;
   
   System.out.println("The 3N+1 sequence starting from " + N);
   System.out.println();
   System.out.println(N);  // print initial term of sequence
 
   while (N &gt; 1) {
       <span class="newcode">N = nextN( N );   // Compute next term, using the function nextN.</span>
       count++;          // Count this term.
       System.out.println(N);  // Print this term.
   }
   
   System.out.println();
   System.out.println("There were " + count + " terms in the sequence.");

}
</pre>

<p>Here are a few more examples of functions. The first one computes a letter
grade corresponding to a given numerical grade, on a typical grading scale:</p>


<pre>/**
 * Returns the letter grade corresponding to the numerical
 * grade that is passed to this function as a parameter.
 */
static char letterGrade(int numGrade) {
   if (numGrade &gt;= 90)
      return 'A';   // 90 or above gets an A
   else if (numGrade &gt;= 80)
      return 'B';   // 80 to 89 gets a B
   else if (numGrade &gt;= 65)
      return 'C';   // 65 to 79 gets a C
   else if (numGrade &gt;= 50)
      return 'D';   // 50 to 64 gets a D
   else
      return 'F';   // anything else gets an F
   
}  // end of function letterGrade</pre>


<p>The type of the return value of <span class="code">letterGrade()</span> is <span class="ptype">char</span>.
Functions can return values of any type at all. Here's a function whose return
value is of type <span class="ptype">boolean</span>. It demonstrates some interesting programming
points, so you should read the comments:</p>


<pre>/**
 * This function returns true if N is a prime number.  A prime number
 * is an integer greater than 1 that is not divisible by any positive 
 * integer, except itself and 1.  If N has any divisor, D, in the range 
 * 1 &lt; D &lt; N, then it has a divisor in the range 2 to Math.sqrt(N), namely
 * either D itself or N/D.  So we only test possible divisors from 2 to 
 * Math.sqrt(N).
 */
static boolean isPrime(int N) {
      
   int divisor;  // A number we will test to see whether it evenly divides N.
   
   if (N &lt;= 1)
      return false;  // No number &lt;= 1 is a prime.
   
   int maxToTry;  // The largest divisor that we need to test.

   maxToTry = (int)Math.sqrt(N);
        // We will try to divide N by numbers between 2 and maxToTry.
        // If N is not evenly divisible by any of these numbers, then 
        // N is prime.  (Note that since Math.sqrt(N) is defined to
        // return a value of type double, the value must be typecast 
        // to type int before it can be assigned to maxToTry.)
        
    for (divisor = 2; divisor &lt;= maxToTry; divisor++) {
        if ( N % divisor == 0 )  // Test if divisor evenly divides N.
           return false;         // If so, we know N is not prime.
                                 // No need to continue testing!
    }
    
    // If we get to this point, N must be prime.  Otherwise,
    // the function would already have been terminated by
    // a return statement in the previous loop.
    
    return true;  // Yes, N is prime.
 
}  // end of function isPrime</pre>


<p>Finally, here is a function with return type <span class="classname">String</span>. This function
has a <span class="classname">String</span> as parameter. The returned value is a reversed copy of
the parameter. For example, the reverse of "Hello World" is "dlroW olleH". The
algorithm for computing the reverse of a string, <span class="code">str</span>, is to start with
an empty string and then to append each character from <span class="code">str</span>, starting
from the last character of <span class="code">str</span> and working backwards to the first:</p>


<pre>static String reverse(String str) {
   String copy;  // The reversed copy.
   int i;        // One of the positions in str, 
                 //       from str.length() - 1 down to 0.
   copy = "";    // Start with an empty string.
   for ( i = str.length() - 1;  i &gt;= 0;  i-- ) {
            // Append i-th char of str to copy.
      copy = copy + str.charAt(i);  
   }
   return copy;
}</pre>


<p>A <span class="newword">palindrome</span> is a string that reads the same
backwards and forwards, such as "radar". The <span class="code">reverse()</span> function could
be used to check whether a string, <span class="code">word</span>, is a palindrome by testing
"<span class="code">if&nbsp;(word.equals(reverse(word)))</span>".</p>


<p>By the way, a typical beginner's error in writing functions is to print out
the answer, instead of returning it. <b>This represents a fundamental
misunderstanding.</b> The task of a function is to compute a value and return it to
the point in the program where the function was called. That's where the value
is used. Maybe it will be printed out. Maybe it will be assigned to a variable.
Maybe it will be used in an expression. But it's not for the function to
decide.</p>
