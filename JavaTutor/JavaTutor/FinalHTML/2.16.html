<a name="basics.5.7">2.5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Precedence Rules</a>
</h3>


<p>If you use several operators in one expression, and if you don't use
parentheses to explicitly indicate the order of evaluation, then you have to
worry about the precedence rules that determine the order of evaluation.
(Advice: don't confuse yourself or the reader of your program; use parentheses
liberally.)</p>


<p>Here is a listing of the operators discussed in this section, listed in
order from highest precedence (evaluated first) to lowest precedence (evaluated
last):</p>


<pre>Unary operators:              ++, --, !, unary -, unary +, type-cast
Multiplication and division:  *,  /,  %
Addition and subtraction:     +,  -
Relational operators:         &lt;,  &gt;,  &lt;=,  &gt;=
Equality and inequality:      ==,  !=
Boolean and:                  &amp;&amp;
Boolean or:                   ||
Conditional operator:         ?:
Assignment operators:         =,  +=,  -=,  *=,  /=,  %=</pre>


<p>Operators on the same line have the same precedence. When operators of the same precedence are strung
together in the absence of parentheses, unary operators and assignment operators are evaluated right-to-left,
while the remaining operators are evaluated left-to-right. For example,
<span class="code">A*B/C</span> means <span class="code">(A*B)/C</span>, while <span class="code">A=B=C</span> means
<span class="code">A=(B=C)</span>. (Can you see how the expression <span class="code">A=B=C</span> might be
useful, given that the value of <span class="code">B=C</span> as an expression is the same as
the value that is assigned to <span class="code">B</span>?)</p>
