<span class="start"><big>I</big>n previous sections of this chapter,</span> we have 
already covered all of Java's control structures.  But before moving on to the next chapter, we will
take preliminary looks at two additional topics that are at least somewhat related to control structures.</p>

<p>This section
is an introduction to arrays.  Arrays are a basic and very commonly used
data structure, and array processing is often an exercise in using control
structures.

</h3>


<p>A <span class="newword">data structure</span> consists of a number of data items
chunked together so that they can be treated as a unit.  An <span class="newword">array</span> is
a data structure in which the items are arranged as a numbered sequence,
so that each individual item can be referred to by its position number.
In Java—but not in some other programming languages—all the items must 
be of the same type, and the numbering always starts at zero.
You will need to learn several new terms to talk about arrays:
The number of items in an array is called the
<span class="newword">length</span> of the array. 
The type of the individual items in an array is called the 
<span class="newword">base type</span> of the array. And the position number of an
item in an array is called the <span class="newword">index</span> of that item.</p>


<p>Suppose that you want to write a program that will process the names of, say, one thousand people.
You will need a way to deal with all that data.  Before you knew about arrays,
you might have thought that the program would need a thousand variables to hold
the thousand names, and if you wanted to print out all the names, you would need
a thousand print statements.  Clearly, that would be ridiculous!  In reality,
you can put all the names into an array.  The array is represented by a single
variable, but it holds the entire list of names.  The length of the array would
be 1000, since there are 1000 individual names.  The base type of the array
would be <span class="classname">String</span> since the items in the array are
strings.  The first name would be at index 0 in the array, the second name
at index 1, and so on, up to the thousandth name at index 999.</p>


<p>The base type of an array can be any Java type, but for now, we will stick to
arrays whose base type is <span class="classname">String</span> or one of the eight primitive
types.   If the base type of an
array is <span class="ptype">int</span>, it is referred to as an "array of <span class="ptype">ints</span>." An
array with base type <span class="classname">String</span> is referred to as an "array of
<span class="classname">Strings</span>." However, an array is not, properly speaking, a list of
integers or strings or other <b>values</b>. It is better thought of
as a list of <b>variables</b> of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, or a list of variables of type
<span class="classname">String</span>, or of some other type. As always, there is some potential for
confusion between the two uses of a variable: as a name for a memory location
and as a name for the value stored in that memory location. Each position in an
array acts as a variable. Each position can hold a value of a specified type
(the base type of the array), just as a variable can hold a value.
The value can be changed at any time, just as the value of a variable can be
changed.  The items in an array—really, the individual variables that make up the
array—are more often referred to as the <span class="newword">elements</span> 
of the array.</p>


<p>As I mentioned above, when you use an array in a program, you can use a variable
to refer to the array as a whole.  But you often need to refer to the individual elements
of the array.  The name for an element of an array is based on the name for the array
and the index number of the element.  The syntax for referring to an element
looks, for example, like this:  <span class="code">namelist[7]</span>.  Here, <span class="code">namelist</span>
is the variable that names the array as a whole, and <span class="code">namelist[7]</span> refers to the
element at index 7 in that array.   That is, to refer to an element of an array,
you use the array name, followed by element index enclosed in square brackets.
An element name of this form can be used like any other variable: You can assign
a value to it, print it out, use it in an expression, and so on.</p>


<p>An array also contains a kind of variable representing its length.  For example,
you can refer to the length of the array <span class="code">namelist</span> as <span class="code">namelist.length</span>.
However, you cannot assign a value to <span class="code">namelist.length</span>, since the length of an
array cannot be changed.
</p>


<p>Before you can use a variable to refer to an array, that
variable must be declared, and it must
have a type.  For an array of <span class="classname">Strings</span>, for example,
the type for the array variable would be <span class="atype">String[]</span>, and
for an array of <span class="ptype">ints</span>, it would be <span class="atype">int[]</span>.
In general, an array type consists of the base type of the array followed
by a pair of empty square brackets.  Array types can be used to declare
variables; for example,</p>


<pre>String[] namelist;
int[] A;
double[] prices;
</pre>


<p>and variables declared in this way can refer to arrays.  However, declaring
a variable does not make the actual array.  Like all variables, an array variable has
to be assigned a value before it can be used.  In this case, the value is
an array.  Arrays have to be created using a special syntax.  (The syntax
is related to the fact that arrays in Java are actually objects, but that doesn't
need to concern us here.)  Arrays are created with an operator named <span class="newword">new</span>.
Here are some examples:</p>


<pre>namelist = new String[1000];
A = new int[5];
prices = new double[100];</pre>


<p>The general syntax is</p>


<pre><span class="bnf">array-variable</span> = new <span class="bnf">base-type</span>[<span class="bnf">array-length</span>];</pre>


<p>The length of the array can be given as either an integer or an integer-valued
expression.  For example, after the assignment statement
"<span class="code">A&nbsp;=&nbsp;new&nbsp;int[5];</span>", <span class="code">A</span> is an array
containing the five integer elements <span class="code">A[0]</span>, <span class="code">A[1]</span>, <span class="code">A[2]</span>, 
<span class="code">A[3]</span>, and <span class="code">A[4]</span>.  Also, <span class="code">A.length</span> would have
the value&nbsp;5.  It's useful to have a picture in mind:</p>

<p>When you create an array of <span class="ptype">int</span>, each element of the array is
automatically initialized to zero.  Any array of numbers is filled with zeros
when it is created.  An array of <span class="ptype">boolean</span> is filled with the
value <span class="code">false</span>.  And an array of <span class="ptype">char</span> is filled
with the character that has Unicode code number zero.  (For an array of
<span class="classname">String</span>, the initial value is <span class="code">null</span>,
a special value used for objects that we won't encounter officially until
