<span class="start"><big>A</big>lthough the basic ideas</span> of object-oriented
programming are reasonably simple and clear, they are subtle, and they take
time to get used to. And unfortunately, beyond the basic ideas there are a lot
of details. The rest of this chapter covers more of those
annoying details. Remember that you don't need to master everything in
this chapter the first time through.  In this
section, we'll look at two variables, <span class="code">this</span> and <span class="code">super</span>, that are
automatically defined in any instance method or constructor.</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.6.1">5.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Variable this</a>
</h3>


<p>What does it mean when you use a simple identifier such as <span class="code">amount</span>
or <span class="code">process()</span> to refer to a variable or method?  The answer depends
on scope rules that tell where and how each declared variable and method can
be accessed in a program.  Inside the definition of a method, a simple variable name might
refer to a local variable or parameter, if there is one "in scope," that is, one
whose declaration is in effect at the point in the source code where the reference
occurs.  If not, it must refer to a member variable of the class in which the
reference occurs.  Similarly, a simple method name must refer to a method in 
the same class.</p>


<p>A <b>static</b> member of a class has a simple name that can only be used inside
the class definition; for use outside the class, it has a full name of the form
<span class="bnf">class-name</span>.<span class="bnf">simple-name</span>. For example, "<span class="code">Math.PI</span>" is a static
member variable with simple name "<span class="code">PI</span>" in the class "<span class="classname">Math</span>".
It's always legal to use the full name of a static member, even within the
class where it's defined. Sometimes it's even necessary, as when the simple
name of a static member variable is hidden by a local variable or parameter of the same
name.</p>


<p>Instance variables and instance methods also have simple names. The simple
name of such an instance member can be used in instance methods in the class
where the instance member is defined (but not in static methods).
Instance members also have full names—but remember that an instance variable
or instance method is actually contained in an object rather than in a class, and each object has its
own version.  A full name of an instance member starts with a
reference to the object that contains the instance member.  For example,
if <span class="code">std</span> is a variable that refers to an object of type <span class="classname">Student</span>,
then <span class="code">std.test1</span> could be a full name for an instance variable named
<span class="code">test1</span> that is contained in that object.</p>


<p>But when we are working inside a class and use a simple name to refer to an instance variable
like <span class="code">test1</span>, where is the object that contains the variable?
The solution to this riddle is simple: Suppose that a reference to "<span class="code">test1</span>"
occurs in the definition of some instance method.  The method is part of some particular object of
type <span class="classname">Student</span>.   When that method gets executed, the
occurrence of the name "<span class="code">test1</span>" refers to the <span class="code">test1</span> variable
<b>in that same object</b>.  (This is why simple names of instance members cannot
be used in static methods—when a static method is executed, it is not part
of an object, and hence there are no instance members in sight!)</p>


<p>This leaves open the question of full names for instance members inside the
same class where they are defined.  We need a way to refer to "the object that
contains this method."  Java defines a special variable named <span class="newword">this</span>
for just this purpose.  The variable <span class="code">this</span> can be used in the source
code of an instance method to refer to the object that contains the method.
This intent of the name, "<span class="code">this</span>," is to refer to "this object," the one
right here that this very method is in.  If <span class="code">var</span> is an instance variable
in the same object as the method, then "<span class="code">this.var</span>" is a full name for that
variable. If <span class="code">otherMethod()</span> is an instance method in the same object,
then <span class="code">this.otherMethod()</span> could be used to call that method. Whenever
the computer executes an instance method, it automatically sets the variable
<span class="code">this</span> to refer to the object that contains the method.</p>


<p>(Some object oriented languages use the name "self" instead of "this."  Here, an
object is seen as an entity that receives messages and responds by performing some
action.  From the point of view of that entity, an instance variable such as
<span class="code">self.name</span> refers to the entity's own <span class="code">name</span>, something
that is part of the entity itself.  Calling an instance method such as 
<span class="code">self.redraw()</span> is like saying "message to self: redraw!")</p>


<p>One common use of <span class="code">this</span> is in constructors. For example:</p>


<pre>public class Student {

    private String name;  // Name of the student.
    
    public Student(String name) {
         // Constructor.  Create a student with specified name.
       this.name = name;
    }
      .
      .   // More variables and methods.
      .
}</pre>


<p>In the constructor, the instance variable called <span class="code">name</span> is hidden by
a formal parameter that is also called "name." 
However, the instance variable can still be referred to by
its full name, which is <span class="code">this.name</span>. In the assignment statement 
"<span class="code">this.name&nbsp;=&nbsp;name</span>", the "name" on the right is the
formal parameter, and the value of
that formal parameter is being assigned to the instance variable,
<span class="code">this.name</span>. This is considered to be acceptable style: There is no need
to dream up cute new names for formal parameters that are just used to
initialize instance variables. You can use the same name for the parameter as
for the instance variable.</p>


<p>There are other uses for <span class="code">this</span>.  Sometimes, when you are writing an
instance method, you need to pass the object that contains the method to a
subroutine, as an actual parameter. In that case, you can use <span class="code">this</span> as
the actual parameter. For example, if you wanted to print out a string
representation of the object, you could say
"<span class="code">System.out.println(this);</span>".  Or you could assign the value of
<span class="code">this</span> to another variable in an assignment statement.  You can store
it in an array.  In fact, you can
do anything with <span class="code">this</span> that you could do with any other variable,
except change its value. (Consider it to be a <span class="code">final</span> variable.)</p>
