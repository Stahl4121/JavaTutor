<a name="OOP.5.2">5.5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Inheritance and Class Hierarchy</a>
</h3>
   

<p>The term <span class="newword">inheritance</span> refers to the fact that
one class can inherit part or all of its structure and behavior from another
class.  The class that does the inheriting is said to be a <span class="newword">subclass</span> 
of the class from which it inherits. If class B is a
subclass of class A, we also say that class A is a <span class="newword">superclass</span> of 
class B. (Sometimes the terms <span class="newword">derived class</span> and <span class="newword">base class</span> are
used instead of subclass and superclass; this is the common terminology in&nbsp;C++.) 
A subclass can add to the structure
and behavior that it inherits. It can also replace or modify inherited behavior
(though not inherited structure). The relationship between subclass and
superclass is sometimes shown by a diagram in which the subclass is shown
below, and connected to, its superclass, as shown on the left below:</p>



<p align="center">

<p>In Java, to create a class named "B" as a subclass of a class named "A", 
you would write</p>


<pre>class B extends A {
    .
    .  // additions to, and modifications of,
    .  // stuff inherited from class A
    .
}</pre>
   


<p>Several classes
can be declared as subclasses of the same superclass. The subclasses, which
might be referred to as "sibling classes," share some structures and behaviors—namely, 
the ones they inherit from their common superclass. The superclass
expresses these shared structures and behaviors. In the diagram shown
on the right above,
classes B, C, and D are sibling classes. Inheritance can also extend over
several "generations" of classes. This is shown in the diagram, where class E
is a subclass of class D which is itself a subclass of class A. In this case,
class E is considered to be a subclass of class A, even though it is not a
direct subclass.  This whole set of classes forms a small
<span class="newword">class hierarchy</span>.</p>

<a name="OOP.5.3">5.5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: Vehicles</a>
</h3>


<p>Let's look at
an example. Suppose that a program has to deal with motor vehicles, including
cars, trucks, and motorcycles. (This might be a program used by a Department of
Motor Vehicles to keep track of registrations.) The program could use a class
named <span class="classname">Vehicle</span> to represent all types of vehicles.  Since cars, trucks,
and motorcycles are types of vehicles, they would be represented by subclasses
of the <span class="classname">Vehicle</span> class, as shown in this class hierarchy diagram:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="./5.5.2+3_files/vehicle-hierarchy.png" width="290" height="123" alt=""></p> 
   

<p>The <span class="classname">Vehicle</span>
class would include instance variables such as <span class="code">registrationNumber</span> and
<span class="code">owner</span> and instance methods such as <span class="code">transferOwnership()</span>. These
are variables and methods common to all vehicles. The three subclasses of
<span class="classname">Vehicle</span>—<span class="classname">Car</span>, 
<span class="classname">Truck</span>, and <span class="classname">Motorcycle</span>—could
then be used to hold variables and methods specific to particular types
of vehicles. The <span class="classname">Car</span> class might add an instance variable
<span class="code">numberOfDoors</span>, the <span class="classname">Truck</span> class might have
<span class="code">numberOfAxles</span>, and the <span class="classname">Motorcycle</span> class could have a boolean
variable <span class="code">hasSidecar</span>. (Well, it <u>could</u> in theory at least, even
if it might give a chuckle to the people at the Department of Motor Vehicles.)
The declarations of these classes in a Java program would look, in outline, like
this (although they are likely to be  defined
in separate files and declared as <span class="code">public</span> classes):</p>


<pre>class Vehicle {
   int registrationNumber;
   Person owner;  // (Assuming that a Person class has been defined!)
   void transferOwnership(Person newOwner) {
       . . .
   }
   . . .
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
   int numberOfDoors;
   . . .
}

class Truck extends Vehicle {
   int numberOfAxles;
   . . .
}

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
   boolean hasSidecar;
   . . .
}</pre>


<p>Suppose that <span class="code">myCar</span> is a variable of type <span class="classname">Car</span> that has been
declared and initialized with the statement</p>


<pre>Car myCar = new Car();</pre>


<p>Given this declaration, a program could refer to
<span class="code">myCar.numberOfDoors</span>, since <span class="code">numberOfDoors</span> is an instance
variable in the class <span class="code">Car</span>. But since class <span class="classname">Car</span> extends class
<span class="classname">Vehicle</span>, a car also has all the structure and behavior of a vehicle.
This means that <span class="code">myCar.registrationNumber</span>, <span class="code">myCar.owner</span>, and
<span class="code">myCar.transferOwnership()</span> also exist.</p>


<p>Now, in the real world, cars, trucks, and motorcycles are in fact vehicles.
The same is true in a program. That is, an object of type <span class="classname">Car</span> or
<span class="classname">Truck</span> or <span class="classname">Motorcycle</span> is automatically an object of type
<span class="classname">Vehicle</span> too. This brings us to the following Important Fact:</p>


<div align="center">
<p>
<b>A variable that can hold a reference<br>
to an object of class A can also hold a reference<br>
to an object belonging to any subclass of A.</b>
</p>

</div>


<p>The practical effect of this in our example is that an object of type
<span class="classname">Car</span> can be assigned to a variable of type <span class="classname">Vehicle</span>. That is,
it would be legal to say</p>


<pre>Vehicle myVehicle = myCar;</pre>


<p>or even</p>


<pre>Vehicle myVehicle = new Car();</pre>


<p>After either of these statements, the variable <span class="code">myVehicle</span> holds a
reference to a <span class="classname">Vehicle</span> object that happens to be an instance of the
subclass, <span class="classname">Car</span>. The object "remembers" that it is in fact a
<span class="classname">Car</span>, and not <b>just</b> a <span class="classname">Vehicle</span>. Information about the
actual class of an object is stored as part of that object. It is even possible
to test whether a given object belongs to a given class, using the
<span class="code">instanceof</span> operator. The test:</p>


<pre>if (myVehicle instanceof Car) ...</pre>


<p>determines whether the object referred to by <span class="code">myVehicle</span> is in fact a
car.</p>


<p>On the other hand, the assignment statement</p>


<pre>myCar = myVehicle;  // ERROR!</pre>


<p>would be illegal because <span class="code">myVehicle</span> could potentially refer to other
types of vehicles that are not cars. This is similar to a problem we saw
previously in <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c2/s5.html#basics.5.6">Subsection&nbsp;2.5.6</a>: The computer will not
allow you to assign an <span class="ptype">int</span> value to a variable of type <span class="ptype">short</span>,
because not every <span class="ptype">int</span> is a <span class="ptype">short</span>. Similarly, it will not
allow you to assign a value of type <span class="classname">Vehicle</span> to a variable of type
<span class="classname">Car</span> because not every vehicle is a car. As in the case of
<span class="ptype">ints</span> and <span class="ptype">shorts</span>, the solution here is to use type-casting.
If, for some reason, you happen to know that <span class="code">myVehicle</span> does in fact
refer to a <span class="classname">Car</span>, you can use the type cast <span class="code">(Car)myVehicle</span> to
tell the computer to treat <span class="code">myVehicle</span> as if it were actually of type
<span class="classname">Car</span>. So, you could say</p>


<pre>myCar = (Car)myVehicle;</pre>


<p>and you could even refer to <span class="code">((Car)myVehicle).numberOfDoors</span>. 
(The parentheses are necessary because of precedence.  The "<span class="code">.</span>"
has higher precedence than the type-cast, so
<span class="code">(Car)myVehicle.numberOfDoors</span> would be read as <span class="code">(Car)(myVehicle.numberOfDoors)</span>,
an attempt to type-cast the <span class="ptype">int</span>
<span class="code">myVehicle.numberOfDoors</span> into a <span class="classname">Vehicle</span>,
which is impossible.)
</p>


<p>As an
example of how this could be used in a program, suppose that you want to print
out relevant data about the <span class="classname">Vehicle</span> referred to by
<span class="code">myVehicle</span>.  If it's a <span class="classname">Car</span>, you will want
to print out the car's <span class="code">numberOfDoors</span>, but you can't
say <span class="code">myVehicle.numberOfDoors</span>, since there is no <span class="code">numberOfDoors</span>
in the <span class="classname">Vehicle</span> class.  But you could say:</p>


<pre>System.out.println("Vehicle Data:");
System.out.println("Registration number:  " 
                              + myVehicle.registrationNumber);
if (myVehicle instanceof Car) {
   System.out.println("Type of vehicle:  Car");
   Car c;
   c = (Car)myVehicle;  // Type-cast to get access to numberOfDoors!
   System.out.println("Number of doors:  " + c.numberOfDoors);
}
else if (myVehicle instanceof Truck) {
   System.out.println("Type of vehicle:  Truck");
   Truck t;
   t = (Truck)myVehicle;  // Type-cast to get access to numberOfAxles!
   System.out.println("Number of axles:  " + t.numberOfAxles);
}
else if (myVehicle instanceof Motorcycle) {
   System.out.println("Type of vehicle:  Motorcycle");
   Motorcycle m;
   m = (Motorcycle)myVehicle;  // Type-cast to get access to hasSidecar!
   System.out.println("Has a sidecar:    " + m.hasSidecar);
}</pre>


<p>Note that for object types, when the computer executes a program, it checks
whether type-casts are valid. So, for example, if <span class="code">myVehicle</span> refers to
an object of type <span class="classname">Truck</span>, then the type cast <span class="code">(Car)myVehicle</span>
would be an error.  When this happens, an exception of type
<span class="classname">ClassCastException</span> is thrown.  This check is done at run time,
not compile time, because the actual type of the object referred to by <span class="code">myVehicle</span>
is not known when the program is compiled.  The code above avoids <span class="classname">ClassCastExceptions</span>
by using <span class="code">instanceof</span> to test the type of the variable before doing a type cast.</p>
