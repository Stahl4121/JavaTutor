<p>We have already seen that one of the major features of object-oriented programming
is the ability to create subclasses of a class.   The subclass inherits all the properties
or behaviors of the class, but can modify and add to what it inherits.  In <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c5/s5.html">Section&nbsp;5.5</a>,
you'll learn how to create subclasses.   What you don't
know yet is that <b>every</b> class in Java (with just one exception) is a subclass
of some other class.  If you create a class and don't explicitly make it a subclass of
some other class, then it automatically becomes a subclass of the special class
named <span class="classname">Object</span>, in package <span class="code">java.lang</span>.  (<span class="classname">Object</span> is the one class
that is not a subclass of any other class.)</p>


<p>Class <span class="classname">Object</span> defines several instance methods that are inherited by
every other class.  These methods can be used with any object whatsoever. I will mention
just one of them here.  You will encounter more of them later in the book.</p>
   

<p>The instance method <span class="code">toString()</span> in class <span class="classname">Object</span> returns
a value of type <span class="classname">String</span> that is supposed to be a string representation
of the object.  You've already used this method implicitly,  any time you've printed out an object or
concatenated an object onto a string.  When you use an object in a context that requires a
string, the object is automatically converted to type <span class="classname">String</span> 
by calling its <span class="code">toString()</span> method.</p>


<p>The version of <span class="code">toString</span> that is defined in <span class="classname">Object</span> just returns
the name of the class that the object belongs to, concatenated with a code number called the
<span class="newword">hash code</span> of the object; this is not very useful. When you create a class,
you can write a new <span class="code">toString()</span> method for it, which will replace the inherited
version.  For example, we might add the following method to any of the <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span>
classes from the previous section:</p>


<pre>/**
 * Return a String representation of a pair of dice, where die1
 * and die2 are instance variables containing the numbers that are
 * showing on the two dice.
 */
public String toString() {
   if (die1 == die2)
      return "double " + die1;
   else
      return die1 + " and " + die2;
}</pre>
   

<p>If <span class="code">dice</span> refers to a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> object, then
<span class="code">dice.toString()</span> will return strings such as "3&nbsp;and&nbsp;6",
"5&nbsp;and&nbsp;1", and "double&nbsp;2", depending on the numbers showing on the dice.
This method would be used automatically to convert <span class="code">dice</span> to type
<span class="classname">String</span> in a statement such as</p>
   

<pre>System.out.println( "The dice came up " + dice );</pre>
   

<p>so this statement might output, "The dice came up 5 and&nbsp;1" or "The
dice came up double 2".  You'll see another example of a <span class="code">toString()</span>
method in the <a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c5/s4.html">next section</a>.</p>
