</h3>
   


<p>Sometimes it is more convenient to test the continuation condition at the
end of a loop, instead of at the beginning, as is done in the <span class="code">while</span>
loop. The <span class="code">do..while</span> statement is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
statement, except that the word "while," along with the condition that it
tests, has been moved to the end. The word "do" is added to mark the beginning
of the loop. A <span class="code">do..while</span> statement has the form</p>


<pre>do
    <span class="bnf">statement</span>
while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> );</pre>


<p>or, since, as usual, the <span class="bnf">statement</span> can be a
block,</p>


<pre>do {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
} while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> );</pre>


<p>Note the semicolon, ';', at the very  end. This semicolon is part of the
statement, just as the semicolon at the end of an assignment statement or
declaration is part of the statement. Omitting it is a syntax error. (More
generally, <b>every</b> statement in Java ends either with a
semicolon or a right brace, '}'.)</p>


<p>To execute a <span class="code">do</span> loop, the computer first executes the body of the
loop—that is, the statement or statements inside the loop—and then it
evaluates the boolean expression. If the value of the expression is
<span class="code">true</span>, the computer returns to the beginning of the <span class="code">do</span> loop and repeats
the process; if the value is <span class="code">false</span>, it ends the loop and continues
with the next part of the program. Since the condition is not tested until the
end of the loop, the body of a <span class="code">do</span> loop is always executed at least once.</p>


<p>For example, consider the following pseudocode for a game-playing program.
The <span class="code">do</span> loop makes sense here instead of a <span class="code">while</span> loop because
with the <span class="code">do</span> loop, you know there will be at least one game. Also, the
test that is used at the end of the loop wouldn't even make sense at the
beginning:</p>


<pre>do {
   Play a Game
   Ask user if he wants to play another game
   Read the user's response
} while ( the user's response is yes );</pre>


<p>Let's convert this into proper Java code. Since I don't want to talk about
game playing at the moment, let's say that we have a class named
<span class="code">Checkers</span>, and that the <span class="code">Checkers</span> class contains a static
member subroutine named <span class="code">playGame()</span> that plays one game of checkers
against the user. Then, the pseudocode "Play a game" can be expressed as the
subroutine call statement "<span class="code">Checkers.playGame();</span>". We need a variable
to store the user's response. The <span class="classname">TextIO</span> class makes it convenient to
use a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variable to store the answer to a yes/no question. The
input function <span class="code">TextIO.getlnBoolean()</span> allows the user to enter the
value as "yes" or "no" (among other acceptable responses). 
"Yes" is considered to be <span class="code">true</span>, and "no" is
considered to be <span class="code">false</span>. So, the algorithm can be coded as</p>


<pre>boolean wantsToContinue;  // True if user wants to play again.
do {
   Checkers.playGame();
   System.out.print("Do you want to play again? ");
   wantsToContinue = TextIO.getlnBoolean();
} while (wantsToContinue == true);</pre>


<p>When the value of the <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variable is set to <span class="code">false</span>, it
is a signal that the loop should end. When a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variable is used
in this way—as a signal that is set in one part of the program and tested in
another part—it is sometimes called a <span class="newword">flag</span> or
<span class="newword">flag variable</span> (in the sense of a signal flag).</p>


<p>By the way, a more-than-usually-pedantic programmer would sneer at the test
"<span class="code">while (wantsToContinue == true)</span>". This test is exactly equivalent to
"<span class="code">while (wantsToContinue)</span>". Testing whether "<span class="code">wantsToContinue&nbsp;==&nbsp;true</span>" 
is true amounts to the same thing as testing whether
"<span class="code">wantsToContinue</span>" is true. A little less offensive is an expression of
the form "<span class="code">flag&nbsp;==&nbsp;false</span>", where <span class="code">flag</span> is a boolean variable.
The value of "<span class="code">flag&nbsp;==&nbsp;false</span>" is exactly the same as the value of
"<span class="code">!flag</span>", where <span class="code">!</span> is the boolean negation operator. So you can
write "<span class="code">while&nbsp;(!flag)</span>" instead of "<span class="code">while (flag&nbsp;==&nbsp;false)</span>", and
you can write "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(!flag)</span>" instead of "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(flag&nbsp;==&nbsp;false)</span>".</p>


<p>Although a <span class="code">do..while</span> statement is sometimes more convenient than a
<span class="code">while</span> statement, having two kinds of loops does not make the language
more powerful. Any problem that can be solved using <span class="code">do..while</span> loops
can also be solved using only <span class="code">while</span> statements, and vice versa. In
fact, if <span class="bnf">doSomething</span> represents any block of
program code, then</p>


<pre>do {
    <span class="bnf">doSomething</span>
} while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> );</pre>


<p>has exactly the same effect as</p>


<pre><span class="bnf">doSomething</span>
while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> ) {
    <span class="bnf">doSomething</span>
}</pre>


<p>Similarly,</p>


<pre>while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> ) {
    <span class="bnf">doSomething</span>
} </pre>


<p>can be replaced by</p>


<pre>if ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> ) {
   do {
       <span class="bnf">doSomething</span>
   } while ( <span class="bnf">boolean-expression</span> );
}</pre>


<p>without changing the meaning of the program in any way.</p>
