<a name="OOP.6.2">5.6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;The Special Variable super</a>
</h3>


<p>Java also defines another special variable, named "<span class="code">super</span>", for use
in the definitions of instance methods. The variable <span class="code">super</span> is for use
in a subclass. Like <span class="code">this</span>, <span class="code">super</span> refers to the object that
contains the method. But it's forgetful. It forgets that the object belongs to
the class you are writing, and it remembers only that it belongs to the
superclass of that class. The point is that the class can contain additions and
modifications to the superclass. <span class="code">super</span> doesn't know about any of those
additions and modifications; it can only be used to refer to methods and
variables in the superclass.</p>


<p>Let's say that the class that you are writing contains an instance method
named <span class="code">doSomething()</span>. Consider the subroutine call statement
<span class="code">super.doSomething()</span>. Now, <span class="code">super</span> doesn't know anything about
the <span class="code">doSomething()</span> method in the subclass. It only knows about things
in the superclass, so it tries to execute a method named <span class="code">doSomething()</span>
from the superclass. If there is none—if the <span class="code">doSomething()</span> method
was an addition rather than a modification—you'll get a syntax error.</p>


<p>The reason <span class="code">super</span> exists is so you can get access to things in the
superclass that are <b>hidden</b> by things in the subclass. For example,
<span class="code">super.var</span> always refers to an instance variable named <span class="code">var</span> in the
superclass. This can be useful for the following reason: If a class contains an
instance variable with the same name as an instance variable in its superclass,
then an object of that class will actually contain two variables with the same
name: one defined as part of the class itself and one defined as part of the
superclass. The variable in the subclass does not <b>replace</b> the
variable of the same name in the superclass; it merely <b>hides</b>
it. The variable from the superclass can still be accessed, using
<span class="code">super</span>.</p>


<p>When a subclass contains an instance method that has the same signature as a
method in its superclass, the method from the superclass is hidden in the same
way. We say that the method in the subclass <span class="newword">overrides</span> 
the method from the superclass. Again, however,
<span class="code">super</span> can be used to access the method from the superclass.</p>


<p>The major use of <span class="code">super</span> is to override a method with a new method
that <b>extends</b> the behavior of the inherited method, instead of
<b>replacing</b> that behavior entirely. The new method can use
<span class="code">super</span> to call the method from the superclass, and then it can add
additional code to provide additional behavior. As an example, suppose you have
a <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class that includes a <span class="code">roll()</span> method. Suppose
that you want a subclass, <span class="classname">GraphicalDice</span>, to represent a pair of dice
drawn on the computer screen. The <span class="code">roll()</span> method in the
<span class="classname">GraphicalDice</span> class should do everything that the <span class="code">roll()</span>
method in the <span class="classname">PairOfDice</span> class does. We can express this with a call
to <span class="code">super.roll()</span>, which calls the method in the superclass. 
But in addition to that, the <span class="code">roll()</span> method
for a <span class="classname">GraphicalDice</span> object has to redraw the dice to show the new
values. The <span class="classname">GraphicalDice</span> class might look something like this:</p>


<pre>public class GraphicalDice extends PairOfDice {

    public void roll() {
            // Roll the dice, and redraw them.
         super.roll();  // Call the roll method from PairOfDice.
         redraw();      // Call a method to draw the dice.
    }
       .
       .  // More stuff, including definition of redraw().
       .
}</pre>


<p>Note that this allows you to extend the behavior of the <span class="code">roll()</span>
method even if you don't know how the method is implemented in the
superclass!</p>
