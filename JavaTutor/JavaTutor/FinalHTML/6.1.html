<span class="start"><big>O</big>bject-oriented programming</span> (OOP) represents an
attempt to make programs more closely model the way people think about and deal
with the world. In the older styles of programming, a programmer who is faced
with some problem must identify a computing task that needs to be performed in
order to solve the problem. Programming then consists of finding a sequence of
instructions that will accomplish that task. But at the heart of
object-oriented programming, instead of tasks we find objects—entities that
have behaviors, that hold information, and that can interact with one another.
Programming consists of designing a set of objects that somehow model the
problem at hand. Software objects in the program can represent real or abstract
entities in the problem domain. This is supposed to make the design of the
program more natural and hence easier to get right and easier to
understand.</p>


<p>To some extent, OOP is just a change in point of view. We can think of an
object in standard programming terms as nothing more than a set of variables
together with some subroutines for manipulating those variables. In fact, it is
possible to use object-oriented techniques in any programming language.
However, there is a big difference between a language that makes OOP possible
and one that actively supports it. An object-oriented programming language such
as Java includes a number of features that make it very different from a
standard language. In order to make effective use of those features, you have
to "orient" your thinking correctly.</p>


<p>As I have mentioned before, in the context of object-oriented programming,
subroutines are often referred to as <span class="newword">methods</span>.  Now that
we are starting to use objects, I will be using the term "method" more often
than "subroutine."</p>


<hr class="break">
<h3 class="subsection_title">
<a name="OOP.1.1">5.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects, Classes, and Instances</a>
</h3>


<p>Objects are closely related to classes. We have already been working with
classes for several chapters, and we have seen that a class can contain
variables and methods (that is, subroutines). If an object is also a collection of variables and
methods, how do they differ from classes? And why does it require a
different type of thinking to understand and use them effectively? In the one
section where we worked with objects rather than classes, 
<a href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c3/s9.html">Section&nbsp;3.9</a>, it didn't seem to make much difference: We
just left the word "<span class="code">static</span>" out of the subroutine definitions!</p>


<p>I have said that classes "describe" objects, or more exactly that the
non-static portions of classes describe objects. But it's probably not very
clear what this means. The more usual terminology is to say that objects
<span class="newword">belong to</span> classes, but this might not be much
clearer. (There is a real shortage of English words to properly distinguish all
the concepts involved. An object certainly doesn't "belong" to a class in the
same way that a member variable "belongs" to a class.) From the point of view
of programming, it is more exact to say that classes are used to create
objects. A class is a kind of factory—or blueprint—for constructing objects. The non-static
parts of the class specify, or describe, what variables and methods the
objects will contain. This is part of the explanation of how objects differ
from classes: Objects are created and destroyed as the program runs, and there
can be many objects with the same structure, if they are created using the same
class.</p>


<p>Consider a simple class whose job is to group together a few static member
variables. For example, the following class could be used to store information
about the person who is using the program:</p>


<pre>class UserData {
    static String name;
    static int age;
}</pre>


<p>In a program that uses this class, there is only one copy of each of the
variables <span class="code">UserData.name</span> and <span class="code">UserData.age</span>.  When the class is
loaded into the computer, there is a section of memory devoted to the class, and
that section of memory includes space for the values of the variables <span class="code">name</span>
and <span class="code">age.</span>  We can picture the class in memory as looking like this:</p>


<p align="center">
<img src="./5.1.1_files/class-userdata.png" width="165" height="128" alt="the UserData class in memory, with space for name and age"></p>


<p>An important point is that the static member variables are part of the representation 
of the class in memory.  
Their full names, <span class="code">UserData.name</span> and <span class="code">UserData.age</span>,
use the name of the class, since they are part of the class. 
When we use class <span class="classname">UserData</span> to represent the user of the program,
there can only be <b>one</b> user, since we only have memory space to store data about one user. Note that
the class, <span class="code">UserData</span>, and the variables it contains exist as long as the
program runs. (That is essentially what it means to be "static.")
Now, consider a similar class that includes some non-static variables:</p>


<pre>class PlayerData {
   static int playerCount;
   String name;
   int age;
}</pre>


<p>I've also included a static variable in the <span class="classname">PlayerData</span> class.
Here, the static variable <span class="code">playerCount</span> is stored as part of the representation of the class in memory.
Its full name is <span class="code">PlayerData.playerCount</span>, and there is only one of it, which exists
as long as the program runs.  However, the other two variables in the class definition are non-static.
There is no such variable as <span class="code">PlayerData.name</span> or
<span class="code">PlayerData.age</span>, since non-static variables do not become part of the
class itself.  But the <span class="classname">PlayerData</span> class can
be used to create objects.   There can be many objects created using the class, and each 
one will have its <b>own</b> variables called <span class="code">name</span> and <span class="code">age</span>.  
This is what it means for the non-static parts of the class to be a template for objects: 
Every object gets its own copy of the non-static part of the class.  We can visualize
the situation in the computer's memory after several objects have been created like this:</p>



<p align="center">
<img src="./5.1.1_files/instance-of-PlayerData.png" width="573" height="358" alt="the PlayerData class and three objects in memory"></p>


<p>Note that the static variable <span class="code">playerCount</span> is part of the class, and there
is only one copy.  On the other hand, every object contains a <span class="code">name</span> and an 
<span class="code">age</span>.  An object that is created from a class is called an <span class="newword">instance</span> of
that class, and as the picture shows, every object "knows" which class was used to create it.
I've shown class <span class="classname">PlayerData</span> as containing something called a
"constructor;" the constructor is a subroutine that creates objects.</p>


<p>Now there can
be many "players," because we can make new objects to represent new players on
demand.  A program might use the <span class="classname">PlayerData</span> class to store information about multiple
players in a game. Each player has a name and an age. When a player joins the
game, a new <span class="code">PlayerData</span> object can be created to represent that player.
If a player leaves the game, the <span class="code">PlayerData</span> object that represents
that player can be destroyed. A system of objects in the program is being used
to <span class="newword">dynamically</span> model what is happening in the game.
You can't do this with static variables!  "Dynamic" is the opposite of "static."</p>


<hr class="break">


<p>An object that is created using a class is said to be an <span class="newword">instance</span> 
of that class.  We will sometimes say that the object <span class="newword">belongs</span> to the class.
The variables that the object contains
are called <span class="newword">instance variables</span>. The methods (that is, subroutines)
that the object contains are called <span class="newword">instance methods</span>. 
For example, if the
<span class="code">PlayerData</span> class, as defined above, is used to create an object, then
that object is an instance of the <span class="code">PlayerData</span> class, and <span class="code">name</span>
and <span class="code">age</span> are instance variables in the object.</p>


<p>My examples here don't include any methods, but methods work similarly to variables.
Static methods are part of the class; non-static, or instance, methods become part of
objects created from the class.  It's not literally true that each object contains
its own copy of the actual compiled code for an instance method. But logically an instance
method is part of the object, and I will continue to say that the object "contains"
the instance method.</p>


<p>Note that you should distinguish between
the <b>source code</b> for the class, and the <b>class itself</b> (in memory).  The
source code determines both the class and the objects that are created from
that class.  The "static" definitions in the source code specify the things
that are part of the class itself (in the computer's memory), whereas the non-static definitions in the
source code specify things that will become part of every instance object
that is created from the class.   By the way, static member
variables and static member subroutines in a class are sometimes called
<span class="newword">class variables</span> and <span class="newword">class methods</span>, 
since they belong to the class itself, rather than to instances
of that class.</p>


<p>As you can see, the static and the non-static portions of a class are very
different things and serve very different purposes. Many classes contain only
static members, or only non-static, and we will see only a few examples of
classes that contain a mixture of the two.  </p>
