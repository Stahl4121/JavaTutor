</h3>


<p>You'll find that adding <span class="code">1</span> to a variable is an extremely common
operation in programming. Subtracting <span class="code">1</span> from a variable is also pretty
common. You might perform the operation of adding <span class="code">1</span> to a variable with
assignment statements such as:</p>


<pre>counter  =  counter + 1;
goalsScored  =  goalsScored + 1;</pre>


<p>The effect of the assignment statement <span class="code">x = x + 1</span> is to take the old
value of the variable <span class="code">x</span>, compute the result of adding <span class="code">1</span> to
that value, and store the answer as the new value of <span class="code">x</span>. The same
operation can be accomplished by writing <span class="code">x++</span> (or, if you prefer,
<span class="code">++x</span>). This actually changes the value of <span class="code">x</span>, so that it has
the same effect as writing "<span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</span>". The two statements above could
be written</p>


<pre>counter++;
goalsScored++;</pre>


<p>Similarly, you could write <span class="code">x--</span> (or <span class="code">--x</span>) to subtract
<span class="code">1</span> from <span class="code">x</span>. That is, <span class="code">x--</span> performs the same computation
as <span class="code">x&nbsp;=&nbsp;x&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span>. Adding <span class="code">1</span> to a variable is called 
<span class="newword">incrementing</span> that variable, and subtracting <span class="code">1</span> is
called <span class="newword">decrementing</span>. The operators <span class="code">++</span> and
<span class="code">--</span> are called the increment operator and the decrement operator,
respectively. These operators can be used on variables belonging to any of the
numerical types and also on variables of type <span class="ptype">char</span>. 
(If <span class="code">ch</span> is <span class="code">'A'</span> then <span class="code">ch++</span> changes the value
of <span class="code">ch</span> to&nbsp;<span class="code">'B'</span>.)</p>


<p>Usually, the operators <span class="code">++</span> or <span class="code">--</span> are used in statements
like "<span class="code">x++</span>;" or "<span class="code">x--</span>;". These statements are commands to
change the value of <span class="code">x</span>. However, it is also legal to use <span class="code">x++</span>,
<span class="code">++x</span>, <span class="code">x--</span>, or <span class="code">--x</span> as expressions, or as parts of
larger expressions. That is, you can write things like:</p>


<pre>y = x++;
y = ++x;
TextIO.putln(--x);
z = (++x) * (y--);</pre>


<p>The statement "<span class="code">y = x++</span>;" has the effects of adding <span class="code">1</span> to
the value of <span class="code">x</span> and, in addition, assigning some value to <span class="code">y</span>.
The value assigned to <span class="code">y</span> is 
defined to be the <b>old</b> value of <span class="code">x</span>, before the
<span class="code">1</span> is added. Thus, if the value of <span class="code">x</span> is <span class="code">6</span>, the
statement "<span class="code">y = x++</span>;" will change the value of <span class="code">x</span> to
<span class="code">7</span>, but it will change the value of <span class="code">y</span> to <span class="code">6</span>, because the
value assigned to <span class="code">y</span> is the <b>old</b> value of <span class="code">x</span>. On the
other hand, the value of <span class="code">++x</span> is defined to be the <b>new</b>
value of <span class="code">x</span>, after the <span class="code">1</span> is added. So if <span class="code">x</span> is
<span class="code">6</span>, then the statement "<span class="code">y = ++x</span>;" changes the values of both
<span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> to <span class="code">7</span>. The decrement operator, <span class="code">--</span>,
works in a similar way.</p>


<p>Note in particular that the statement <span class="code">x = x++;</span> <b>does not change the value of x</b>!
This is because the value that is being assigned to x is the old value of x, the one that it had
before the statement was executed.  The net result is that x is incremented but then immediately
changed back to its previous value!  You also need to remember that <span class="code">x++</span> is <b>not</b>
the same as <span class="code">x&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</span>.  The expression <span class="code">x++</span> changes the value of x;
the expression <span class="code">x&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</span> does not.</p>


<p>This can be confusing, and I have seen many bugs in student programs resulting from the confusion.
My advice is: Don't be confused. Use <span class="code">++</span> and
<span class="code">--</span> only as stand-alone statements, not as expressions. I will follow
this advice in almost all examples in these notes.</p>
