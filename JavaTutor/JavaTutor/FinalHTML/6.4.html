<p>When writing new classes, it's a good idea to pay attention to the issue
of access control.  Recall that making a member of a class <span class="code">public</span>
makes it accessible from anywhere, including from other classes.  On the
other hand, a <span class="code">private</span> member can only be used in the class
where it is defined.</p>
   

<p>In the opinion of many programmers, almost all member variables should
be declared <span class="code">private</span>.  This gives you complete control over what
can be done with the variable.  Even if the variable itself is private,
you can allow other classes to find out what its value is by providing
a <span class="code">public</span> <span class="newword">accessor method</span> that returns the
value of the variable.  For example, if your class contains a <span class="code">private</span>
member variable, <span class="code">title</span>, of type <span class="classname">String</span>, you
can provide a method</p>


<pre>public String getTitle() {
    return title;
}</pre>

   

<p>that returns the value of <span class="code">title</span>.  By convention, the name of
an accessor method for a variable is obtained by capitalizing the name of variable and
adding "get" in front of the name.  So, for the variable <span class="code">title</span>, we get
an accessor method named "get" <span class="code">+</span> "Title", or <span class="code">getTitle()</span>.
Because of this naming convention, accessor methods are more often referred to
as <span class="newword">getter methods</span>.  A getter method provides "read access" to
a variable.  (Sometimes for <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variables, "is" is used in place
of "get".  For example, a getter for a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> member variable named
<span class="code">done</span> might be called <span class="code">isDone()</span>.)</p>
   

<p>You might also want to allow "write access" to a <span class="code">private</span> variable.
That is, you might want to make it possible for other classes to specify a new value
for the variable.  This is done with a <span class="newword">setter method</span>.  (If you don't
like simple, Anglo-Saxon words, you can use the fancier term <span class="newword">mutator method</span>.)
The name of a setter method should consist of "set" followed by a capitalized copy of
the variable's name, and it should have a parameter with the same type as the
variable.  A setter method for the variable <span class="code">title</span> could be written</p>
   

<pre>public void setTitle( String newTitle ) {
   title = newTitle;
}</pre>
   

<p>It is actually very common to provide both a getter and a setter method for
a private member variable.  Since this allows other classes both to see and to
change the value of the variable, you might wonder why not just make the
variable <span class="code">public</span>?  The reason is that getters and setters are not
restricted to simply reading and writing the variable's value.  In fact,
they can take any action at all.  For example, a getter method might keep
track of the number of times that the variable has been accessed:</p>


<pre>public String getTitle() {
    titleAccessCount++;  // Increment member variable titleAccessCount.
    return title;
}</pre>


<p>and a setter method might check that the value that is being
assigned to the variable is legal:</p>
   

<pre>public void setTitle( String newTitle ) {
   if ( newTitle == null )   // Don't allow null strings as titles!
      title = "(Untitled)";  // Use an appropriate default value instead.
   else
      title = newTitle;
}</pre>
   

<p>Even if you can't think of any extra chores to do in a getter or setter
method, you might change your mind in the future when you redesign and
improve your class.  If you've used a getter and setter from the beginning,
you can make the modification to your class without affecting any of the
classes that use your class.  The <span class="code">private</span> member variable
is not part of the public interface of your class; only the <span class="code">public</span>
getter and setter methods are, and you are free to change their implementations
without changing the public interface of your class.
If you <b>haven't</b> used get and set from
the beginning, you'll have to contact everyone who uses your class and
tell them, "Sorry people, you'll have to track down every use that you've
made of this variable and change your code to use my new get and set
methods instead."</p>
   

<p>A couple of final notes:  Some advanced aspects of Java rely on the
naming convention for getter and setter methods, so it's a good idea to
follow the convention rigorously.  And though I've been talking about using
getter and setter methods for a variable, you can define get and set
methods even if there is no variable.  A getter and/or setter method defines
a <span class="newword">property</span> of the class, that might or might not correspond
to a variable.  For example, if a class includes a <span class="code">public</span> <span class="code">void</span>
instance method with signature <span class="code">setValue(double)</span>, then the class
has a "property" named <span class="code">value</span> of type <span class="ptype">double</span>, and
it has this property whether or not the class has a member variable
named <span class="code">value</span>.
